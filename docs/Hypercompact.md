# Hypercompact











*Hypercompactness* is a large cardinal property that is a strengthening
of
[supercompactness](Supercompact "Supercompact").
A cardinal $\\kappa$ is *$\\alpha$-hypercompact* if and only if for
every ordinal $\\beta &lt; \\alpha$ and for every cardinal
$\\lambda\\geq\\kappa$, there exists a cardinal $\\lambda'\\geq\\lambda$
and an elementary embedding $j:V\\to M$ generated by a [normal fine
ultrafilter](Filter "Filter")
on $P\_\\kappa\\lambda$ such that $\\kappa$ is $\\beta$-hypercompact in
$M$. $\\kappa$ is *hypercompact* if and only if it is
$\\beta$-hypercompact for every ordinal $\\beta$.

Every cardinal is 0-hypercompact, and 1-hypercompactness is equivalent
to supercompactness.
