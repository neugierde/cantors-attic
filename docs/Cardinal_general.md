When the axiom of choice is not available, the concept of cardinality is
somewhat more subtle, and there is in general no fully satisfactory
solution of the cardinal assignment problem. Rather, in ZF one works
directly with the equinumerosity relation.

In ZF, the [axiom of
choice](Axiom_of_choice "Axiom of choice")
is equivalent to the assertion that the cardinals are linearly ordered.
This is because for every set \$X\$, there is a smallest ordinal
\$\alpha\$ that does not inject into \$X\$, the [Hartog
number](Hartog_number "Hartog number")
of \$X\$, and conversely, if \$X\$ injects into \$\alpha\$, then \$X\$
would be well-orderable.

## Dedekind finite sets

The *[Dedekind
finite](Dedekind_finite "Dedekind finite")*
sets are those not equinumerous with any proper subset. Although in ZFC
this is an equivalent characterization of the finite sets, in ZF the two
concepts of finite differ: every finite set is Dedekind finite, but it
is consistent with ZF that there are infinite Dedekind finite sets. An
*amorphous* set is an infinite set, all of whose subsets are either
finite or co-finite.
