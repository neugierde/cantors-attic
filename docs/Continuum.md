The *continuum* is the cardinality of the reals $\\mathbb{R}$, and is variously denoted $\\frak{c}$, $2^{\\aleph\_0}$, $|\\mathbb{R}|$, $\\beth\_1$, $2^\\omega$.

## Continuum hypothesis

The *continuum hypothesis* is the assertion that the continuum is the same as the first uncountable cardinal [$\\aleph\_1$](Aleph_one "Aleph one"). The *generalized continuum hypothesis* is the assertion that for any infinite cardinal $\\kappa$, the power set $P(\\kappa)$ has the same cardinality as the [successor](Successor "Successor") cardinal $\\kappa^+$. This is equivalent, by transfinite induction, to the assertion that $\\aleph\_\\alpha=\\beth\_\\alpha$ for every ordinal $\\alpha$.
