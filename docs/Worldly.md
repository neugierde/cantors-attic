A cardinal \$\kappa\$ is *worldly* if \$V\_\kappa\$ is a model of
\$\text{ZF}\$. It follows that \$\kappa\$ is a
<a href="Strong_limit"
class="mw-redirect" title="Strong limit">strong limit</a>, a
<a href="Beth_fixed_point"
class="mw-redirect" title="Beth fixed point">beth fixed point</a> and a
fixed point of the enumeration of these, and more.

- Every
  [inaccessible](Inaccessible "Inaccessible")
  cardinal is worldly. (See <a
  href="Grothendieck_universe"
  class="mw-redirect" title="Grothendieck universe">Grothendieck
  universe</a>)
- Nevertheless, the least worldly cardinal is
  <a href="Singular"
  class="mw-redirect" title="Singular">singular</a> and hence not
  [inaccessible](Inaccessible "Inaccessible").
- The least worldly cardinal has
  <a href="Cofinality"
  class="mw-redirect" title="Cofinality">cofinality</a> \$\omega\$.
- Indeed, the next worldly cardinal above any ordinal, if any exist, has
  <a href="Cofinality"
  class="mw-redirect" title="Cofinality">cofinality</a> \$\omega\$.
- Any worldly cardinal \$\kappa\$ of uncountable cofinality is a limit
  of \$\kappa\$ many worldly cardinals.

## Degrees of worldliness

A cardinal \$\kappa\$ is *\$1\$-worldly* if it is worldly and a limit of
worldly cardinals. More generally, \$\kappa\$ is *\$\alpha\$-worldly* if
it is worldly and for every \$\beta\lt\alpha\$, the \$\beta\$-worldly
cardinals are unbounded in \$\kappa\$. The cardinal \$\kappa\$ is
*hyper-worldly* if it is \$\kappa\$-worldly. One may proceed to define
notions of \$\alpha\$-hyper-worldly and
\$\alpha\$-hyper\${}^\beta\$-worldly in analogy with the
[hyper-inaccessible
cardinals](Inaccessible#hyper-inaccessible "Inaccessible").
Every
[inaccessible](Inaccessible "Inaccessible")
cardinal \$\kappa\$ is hyper\${}^\kappa\$-worldly, and a limit of such
kinds of cardinals.

The consistency strength of a \$1\$-worldly cardinal is stronger than
that of a worldly cardinal, the consistency strength of a \$2\$-worldly
cardinal is stronger than that of a \$1\$-worldly cardinal, etc.

The worldly cardinal terminology was introduced in lectures of J. D.
Hamkins at the CUNY Graduate Center and at NYU.

## Replacement characterization

As long as \$\kappa\$ is an uncountable cardinal, \$V\_\kappa\$ already
satisfies \$\text{ZF}\setminus\textrm{Replacement}\$ (\$\text{ZF}\$
without the axiom schema of replacement). So, \$\kappa\$ is worldly if
and only if \$\kappa\$ is uncountable and \$V\_\kappa\$ satisfies the
axiom schema of replacement. More analytically, \$\kappa\$ is worldly if
and only if \$\kappa\$ is uncountable and for any function
\$f:A\rightarrow V\_\kappa\$ definable from parameters in \$V\_\kappa\$
for some \$A\in V\_\kappa\$, \$f^{\prime\prime}A\in V\_\kappa\$ also.

## Otherworldly cardinals

J. D. Hamkins has named a large cardinal property called the
*otherworldly cardinals*: \$\kappa\$ is otherworldly (to \$\lambda\$) if
there exists some \$\lambda\>\kappa\$ such that \$V\_\kappa\prec
V\_\lambda\$. <a

If \$\kappa\$ is inaccessible and otherworldly to a \$\lambda\$ that is
greater than some ordinal \$\theta\$, then \$\kappa\$ is
\$\theta\$-pseudo-[uplifting](Uplifting "Uplifting").

\$\kappa\$ is called otherworldly up to \$\lambda\$ if the set of
\$\mu\$ such that \$\kappa\$ is otherworldly to \$\mu\$ is cofinal in
\$\lambda\$.

Otherworldly \$\kappa\$ have some properties:

- Every otherworldly cardinal is worldly (which played a part in
  inspiring the name), and also happens to be a limit of worldly
  cardinals.
- Every otherworldly \$\kappa\$ is a limit of cardinals
  \$\lambda\<\kappa\$ such that \$Th(V\_\lambda)=Th(V\_\kappa)\$.
- Every inaccessible \$\delta\$ is a limit of otherworldly cardinals.
  - In fact, inaccessible \$\delta\$ is the supremum of the class
    \$\\\kappa\in\delta\mid V\_\kappa\prec V\_\delta\\\$.
    - \$\delta\$ is a limit of cardinals otherworldly up to and to
      \$\delta\$.
- A cardinal is otherworldly iff if it is fully correct in a worldly
  cardinal.

A cardinal \$\kappa\$ is *totally otherworldly* if for all
\$\lambda\>\kappa\$ we have \$V\_\kappa\prec V\_\lambda\$ (\$\kappa\$ is
otherworldly to arbitrarily large ordinals).

- Every totally otherworldly cardinal is \$\Sigma_3\$-correct. <a
