*In construction.*

$\\text{ZFC}$, the usual first-order axiomatic set theory, can only manipulate sets, and cannot formalize the notion of a proper class (e.g. the class of all sets, $V$), so when one needs to manipulate proper class objects, it is tempting to switch to a second-order logic form of $\\text{ZFC}$. However, because many useful theorems such as Gödel's Completeness Theorem does not apply to second-order logic theories, it is more convenient to use first-order two-sorted axiomatic theories with two types of variables, one for sets and one for classes. Two such "false" second-order theories, $\\text{NBG}$ and $\\text{MK}$, are the most widely used extensions of $\\text{ZFC}$.

Throughout this article, "*first-order (set theory) formula*" means a formula in the language of $\\text{ZFC}$, eventually with class parameters, but only set quantifiers. "*second-order (set theory) formula*" means a formula in the language of $\\text{NBC}$ and $\\text{MK}$, i.e. it can contain class quantifiers.

**Von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel set theory** (commonly abbreviated as *$\\text{NBG}$* or *$\\text{GCB}$*) is a conservative extension of $\\text{ZFC}$ - that is, it proves the same first-order sentences as $\\text{ZFC}$. It is equiconsistent with $\\text{ZFC}$. However, unlike $\\text{ZFC}$ and $\\text{MK}$, it is possible to finitely axiomatize $\\text{NBG}$. It was named after John von Neumann, Paul Bernays and Kurt Gödel.

**Morse-Kelley set theory** (commonly abbreviated as *$\\text{MK}$* or *$\\text{KM}$*) is an extension of $\\text{NBG}$ which is stronger than $\\text{ZFC}$ and $\\text{NBG}$ in consistency strength. It was named after John L. Kelley and Anthony Morse. It only differs from $\\text{NBG}$ by a single axiom-schema. It is not finitely axiomatizable.

It is possible to turn both theories into first-order axiomatic set theories with only class variables, a class $X$ is called a set (abbreviated $\\text{M}X$) iff $\\exists Y(X\\in Y)$. One can also define $\\text{M}X\\equiv X\\in V$ with $V$ a symbol of the language representing the universal class containing all sets. That is, a set is a class member of another class.

## Axioms of $\\text{NBG}$ and $\\text{MK}$

We will be using capital letters to denote classes and lowercase letters to denote sets. The following axioms are common to both $\\text{NBG}$ and $\\text{MK}$:
-    **Extensionality:** two classes are equal iff they have the same elements: $\\forall X\\forall Y(X=Y\\iff\\forall z(z\\in X\\iff z\\in Y))$.
-    **Regularity:** every class is disjoint from one of its elements: $\\forall X(\\exists a(a\\in X)\\implies\\exists x(x\\in X\\land\\forall y(y\\in x\\implies y\\not\\in X)))$.
-    **Infinity:** there exists an infinite set. For example, $\\exists x(\\exists a(a\\in x)\\land\\forall y(y\\in x\\implies\\exists z(y\\in z\\land z\\in x))$.
-    **Union:** the union of the elements of a set is a set : $\\forall x\\exists y\\forall z(z\\in y\\iff\\exists w(z\\in w\\land w\\in x))$.
-    **Pairing:** the pair of two sets is itself a set: $\\forall x\\forall y\\exists z\\forall w(w\\in z\\iff(w=x\\lor w=y))$.
-    **Powerset:** the powerset of a set is a set: $\\forall x\\exists y\\forall z(z\\in y\\iff\\forall w(w\\in z\\implies w\\in x))$.
-    **Limitation of Size:** a class $X$ is proper if and only if there is  bijection between $X$ and the universal class $V$.

The axiom of limitation of size implies the axiom of global choice ("there is a well-ordering of the universe") and $\\text{ZFC}$'s axiom of replacement. Using the one-sorted version of those theories, pairing becomes $\\forall X\\forall Y(\\text{M}X\\land\\text{M}Y\\Rightarrow\\exists Z(\\text{M}Z\\land X\\in Z\\land Y\\in Z))$. The other axioms are modified similarly.

$\\text{NBG}$ the the theory obtained by adding the following axiom-scheme:
-    **Class comprehension:** for every *first-order* formula $\\varphi(x)$ with a free variables $x$ and class parameters, there exists a class containing all sets $x$ such that $\\varphi(x)$.
Not that the created class only contains sets, in particular there is no class of all classes.

$\\text{MK}$ is obtained by removing the "first-order" restriction in class comprehension, i.e. second-order formulas are now allowed.

### Finitely axiomatizing $\\text{NBG}$

$\\text{NBG}$ can be finitely axiomatized as its class comprehension axiom can be replaced by the following set of axioms:
For every classes $A$ and $B$,
-    The complement $V\\setminus A=\\{x:x\\not\\in A\\}$ exists.
-    The intersection $A\\cap B=\\{x:x\\in A\\land x\\in B\\}$ exists.
-    The range $\\{y:\\exists x((x,y)\\in A\\}$ exists, using $(x,y)=\\{\\{x\\},\\{x,y\\}\\}$.
-    The product $A\\times B=\\{(a,b):a\\in A\\land b\\in B\\}$ exists.
-    The classes $\\{(x,y):x\\in y\\}$ and $\\{(x,y):x=y\\}$ exist.
-    The following classes exist: $\\{(b,a):(a,b)\\in A\\}$, $\\{(b,(a,c)):(a,(b,c))\\in A\\}$.
-    The following classes exist: $\\{((a,b),c):(a,(b,c))\\in A\\}$, $\\{(d,(a,(b,c))):(d,((a,b),c))\\in A\\}$.

## Models of $\\text{MK}$

In consistency strength, $\\text{MK}$ is stronger than [$\\text{ZFC}$](ZFC "ZFC") and weaker than the existence of an [inaccessible](Inaccessible "Inaccessible") cardinal. It directly implies the consistency of $\\text{ZFC}$ plus "there is a proper class of [worldly](Worldly "Worldly") cardinals stationary in $\\text{Ord}$". However, if a cardinal $\\kappa$ is inaccessible then $V\_{\\kappa+1}\\models\\text{MK}$, also $\\text{def}(V\_\\kappa)$ satisfies $\\text{NBG}$ minus global choice (i.e. replacing limitation of size by $\\text{ZFC}$'s axiom of replacement).

Because it uses classes, set models of $\\text{MK}$ are generally taken to be the powerset of some model of $\\text{ZFC}$. For this reason, a large cardinal axiom with $V\_\\kappa$ having some elementary property can be strengthened by instead using $V\_{\\kappa+1}$. When doing this with [$\\Pi\_m^0$-indescribability](Indescribable "Indescribable"), one achieves [$\\Pi\_m^1$-indescribability](Indescribable "Indescribable") (which is considerably stronger). When doing this with [0-extendibility](Extendible "Extendible") (which is equiconsistent with $\\text{ZFC}$), one achieves [1-extendibility](Extendible "Extendible").

## Mose-Kelley set theory

The axioms of $\\text{MK}$ are exactly those of [$\\text{NBG}$](NBG "NBG") except with a modified **Axiom Schema of Class Comprehension**. This modified version allows classes to be defined using other classes, as long as none of them are that class. Specifically, for any $\\phi$ and any $n$:

$$\\forall W\_1\\forall W\_2...\\forall W\_n(\\neg\\forall x(\\phi(x,W\_1...W\_n)\\Leftrightarrow x\\in W\_1)\\land \\neg\\forall x(\\phi(x,W\_1...W\_n)\\Leftrightarrow x\\in W\_2)...\\neg\\forall x(\\phi(x,W\_1...W\_n)\\Leftrightarrow x\\in W\_n)$$
$$\\rightarrow\\exists Y(\\forall x(\\phi(x,W\_1...W\_n)\\Leftrightarrow x\\in Y))$$

In other words, for any formula $\\phi$ with variables $x$ and $W\_1,...,W\_n$, there is a class $Y=\\{x:\\phi(x,W\_1...W\_n)\\}$ as long as no $W\_m=Y$ and $Y$ does not occur in $\\phi$. This is because, if we allowed $Y$ to occur in $\\phi$ or if we allowed $Y$ to be passed as a parameter for $\\phi$, then we could create a sentence $\\phi$ such that $\\phi(x,W\_1,...,W\_n)\\iff x\\not\\in Y$, and then we would have $\\forall x(x\\in Y\\iff x\\not\\in Y)$, a contradiction. This is generally considered to be a useful definition for a class, allowing almost all known "useful" classes to be created.

The other most important axiom (which is also in $\\text{NBG}$) is the **Axiom of Limitation of Size**, which asserts that a class is not a set iff it has a bijection onto $V$. This is a particularly strong axiom, implying the [Axiom of Choice](Axiom_of_Choice "Axiom of Choice"). Furthermore, it implies that every class can be well-ordered (known as the axiom of global choice).
