A limit ordinal is an [ordinal](Ordinal "Ordinal") that is neither [$0$](Zero "Zero") nor a [successor ordinal](Successor_ordinal "Successor ordinal"). Some authors classify zero as a limit ordinal.

## Properties

All limit ordinals are equal to their union.

All limit ordinals contain an ordinal $\\alpha$ if and only if they contain $\\alpha + 1$.

$\\omega$ is the smallest nonzero limit ordinal, and the smallest ordinal of infinite [cardinal](Cardinal "Cardinal") number.

$(\\omega + \\omega)$, also written $( \\omega \\cdot 2 )$, is the next limit ordinal.  $( \\omega \\cdot \\alpha )$ is a limit ordinal for any ordinal $\\alpha$.

## Types of Limits

A limit ordinal $\\alpha$ is called *additively indecomposable* (or a $\\gamma$ number) if it cannot be the sum of $\\beta<\\alpha$ ordinals less than $\\alpha$. These numbers are any ordinal of the form $\\omega^\\beta$ for $\\beta$ an ordinal. The smallest is written $\\gamma\_0$, and the smallest larger than that is $\\gamma\_1$, etc.

A limit ordinal $\\alpha$ is called *multiplicatively indecomposable* (or a $\\delta$ number) if it cannot be the product of $\\beta<\\alpha$ ordinals less than $\\alpha$. These numbers are any ordinal of the form $\\omega^{\\omega^{\\beta}}$. The smallest is written $\\delta\_0$, and the smallest larger than that is $\\delta\_1$, etc.

Interestingly, this pattern does not continue with *exponentially indecomposable* (or $\\varepsilon$ numbers) ordinals being $\\omega^{\\omega^{\\omega^\\beta}}$, but rather $\\varepsilon\_0=sup\_{n<\\omega}f^n(0)$ with $f(\\alpha)=\\omega^\\alpha$ and $f^n(\\alpha)=f(f(...f(\\alpha)...))$ with $n$ iterations of $f$. It is the smallest fixed point of $f$. The next $\\varepsilon$ number (i.e. the next fixed point of $f$) is then $\\varepsilon\_1=sup\_{n<\\omega}f^n(\\varepsilon\_0+1)$, and more generally the $(\\alpha+1)$th fixed point of $f$ is $\\varepsilon\_{\\alpha+1}=sup\_{n<\\omega}f^n(\\varepsilon\_\\alpha+1)$, also $\\varepsilon\_\\lambda=\\cup\_{\\alpha<\\lambda}\\varepsilon\_\\alpha$ for limit $\\lambda$.

The *tetrationally indecomposable* ordinals (or $\\zeta$ numbers) are then the ordinals $\\zeta$ such that $\\varepsilon\_\\zeta=\\zeta$. These are obtained similarly as $\\varepsilon$ numbers by taking $f(\\alpha)=\\varepsilon\_\\alpha$. *Pentationally indecomposable* ordinals (or $\\eta$ ordinals) are then obtained by taking $f(\\alpha)=\\zeta\_\\alpha$, and so on.

This pattern continues on with the [Veblen Hiearchy](Feferman-Schütte "Feferman-Schütte"), continuing up to the [Feferman-Schütte](Feferman-Schütte "Feferman-Schütte") ordinal $\\Gamma\_0$, the smallest ordinal such that this process does not generate any larger kind of ordinals.
