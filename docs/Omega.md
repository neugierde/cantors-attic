The smallest infinite ordinal, often denoted \$\omega\$ (omega), has the
order type of the natural numbers. As a [von Neumann
ordinal](Ordinal "Ordinal"),
\$\omega\$ is in fact equal to the set of natural numbers. Since
\$\omega\$ is infinite, it is not equinumerous with any smaller ordinal,
and so it is an <a

class="new" title="Initial ordinal (page does not exist)">initial
ordinal</a>, that is, a
[cardinal](Cardinal "Cardinal").
When considered as a cardinal, the ordinal \$\omega\$ is denoted
\$\aleph_0\$. So while these two notations are intensionally
different---we use the term \$\omega\$ when using this number as an
ordinal and \$\aleph_0\$ when using it as a cardinal---nevertheless in
the contemporary treatment of cardinals in ZFC as initial ordinals, they
are extensionally the same and refer to the same object.

  

## Countable sets

A set is *countable* if it can be put into bijective correspondence with
a subset of \$\omega\$. This includes all finite sets, and a set is
*countably infinite* if it is countable and also infinite. Some famous
examples of countable sets include:

- The natural numbers \$\mathbb{N}=\\0,1,2,\ldots\\\$.
- The integers \$\mathbb{Z}=\\\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\ldots\\\$
- The rational numbers \$\mathbb{Q}=\\\frac{p}{q}\mid p,q\in\mathbb{Z},
  q\neq 0\\\$
- The real algebraic numbers \$\mathbb{A}\$, consisting of all zeros of
  nontrivial polynomials over \$\mathbb{Q}\$

The union of countably many countable sets remains countable, although
in the general case this fact requires the [axiom of
choice](Axiom_of_choice "Axiom of choice").

A set is

countable.
