The near $\\theta$-supercompactness hierarchy of cardinals was introduced by Jason Schanker in <CITE>Schanker:PartialNearSupercompactness</CITE> and <CITE>Schanker2011:Thesis</CITE>.  The hierarchy stratifies the $\\theta$-supercompactness hierarchy in the sense that every $\\theta$-supercompact cardinal is nearly $\\theta$-supercompact, and every nearly $2^{\\theta^{{<}\\kappa}}$-supercompact cardinal $\\kappa$ is $\\theta$-supercompact.  However, these cardinals can be very different.  For example, relative to the existence of a supercompact cardinal $\\kappa$ with an inaccessible cardinal $\\theta$ above it, we can force to destroy $\\kappa$'s measurability while still retaining its near $\\theta$-supercompactness and the [weak inaccessibility](Weakly_inaccessible "Weakly inaccessible") of $\\theta$.  Yet, if $\\theta^{{<}\\kappa} = \\theta$ and $\\kappa$ is $\\theta$-supercompact, we can also force to preserve $\\kappa$'s $\\theta$-supercompactness while destroying any potential near $\\theta^+$-supercompactness without collapsing cardinals below $\\theta^{++}$.  Assuming that $\\theta^{{<}\\kappa} = \\theta$, nearly $\\theta$-supercompact cardinals $\\kappa$ exhibit a hybrid of [weak compactness](Weakly_compact "Weakly compact") and [supercompactness](Supercompact "Supercompact") in that the witnessing [embeddings](Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding") are between $\\text{ZFC}^-$ ($\\text{ZFC}$ minus the powerset axiom) models of size $\\theta$ but are generated by "partially normal" fine [filters](Filter "Filter") on $\\mathcal{P}\_{\\kappa}(\\theta$).  [Weakly compact](Weakly_compact "Weakly compact") cardinals $\\kappa$ are  nearly $\\kappa$-supercompact.
 
## Formal definition

A cardinal $\\kappa$ is *nearly $\\theta$-supercompact* if and only if for every $A\\subseteq\\theta$, there exists a transitive $M \\vDash ZFC^{-}$ closed under ${<}\\kappa$ sequences with $A, \\kappa, \\theta \\in M$, a transitive $N$, and an [elementary embedding](Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding") $j: M \\rightarrow N$ with critical point $\\kappa$ such that $j(\\kappa) > \\theta$ and $j''\\theta \\in N$.  A cardinal is *nearly supercompact* if it is nearly $\\theta$-supercompact for all $\\theta$.

## Characterizations of near $\\theta$-supercompactness

If $\\theta^{{<}\\kappa} = \\theta$, then the following are equivalent characterizations for the near $\\theta$-supercompactness of $\\kappa$:

:; Embedding : For every ${<}\\kappa$-closed transitive set $M$ of size $\\theta$ with $\\theta \\in M$, there exists a transitive $N$ and an elementary embedding $j: M \\rightarrow N$ with critical point $\\kappa$ such that $j(\\kappa) > \\theta$ and $j''\\theta \\in N$.

:; Normal Embedding :

:; Normal ZFC Embedding :

:; Normal Fine Filter : For every family of subsets $\\mathcal{A} \\subset \\mathcal{P}\_\\kappa(\\theta)$ of size at most $\\theta$ and every collection $\\mathcal{F}$ of at most $\\theta$ many functions from $\\mathcal{P}\_{\\kappa}(\\theta)$ into $\\theta$, there exists a $\\kappa$-complete fine [filter](Filter "Filter") $F$ on $\\mathcal{P}\_{\\kappa}(\\theta)$, which is $\\mathcal{F}$-normal in the sense that for every $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ that's regressive on some set in $F$, there exists $\\alpha\_f < \\theta$ for which $\\{\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{P}\_{\\kappa}(\\theta)| f(\\sigma) = \\alpha\_f\\} \\in F$.
