*High-jump* cardinals are a certain kind of large cardinals. A cardinal
\$\kappa\$ is *high-jump* if it is the critical point of an [elementary
embedding](Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding")
\$j:V\to M\$ such that \$M\$ is closed under sequences of length
\$\text{sup}\\j(f)(\kappa)\|f:\kappa\to\kappa\\\$. This closure
condition is a weakening of the definition of a
[huge](Huge "Huge")
cardinal.

## Definition

Let \$j:M\to N\$ be a (nontrivial) elementary embedding. The *clearance*
of \$j\$ is the ordinal \$\text{sup}\\j(f)(\kappa)\$ \$\|\$
\$f:\kappa\to\kappa,f\in M\\\$ where \$\kappa\$ is the critical point of
\$j\$.

A cardinal \$\kappa\$ is **high-jump** if there exists \$j:V\to M\$ with
critical point \$\kappa\$ and clearance \$\theta\$ such that
\$M^\theta\subseteq M\$, i.e. \$M\$ contains all sequences of elements
of \$M\$ of length \$\theta\$. \$j\$ is called a *high-jump embedding*,
and a [normal fine
ultrafilter](Filter "Filter")
on some \$\mathcal{P}\_\kappa(\lambda)\$ generating an [ultrapower
embedding](Ultrapower "Ultrapower")
that is high-jump is a *high-jump ultrafilter* (or *high-jump measure*).

\$\kappa\$ is called *almost high-jump* if \$M\$ is closed under
sequences of length \$\<\theta\$ instead, i.e. \$M^\lambda\subseteq M\$
for all \$\lambda\<\theta\$. \$j\$ is then an *almost high-jump*
embedding. This means that for all \$f:\kappa\to\kappa\$,
\$M^{j(f)(\kappa)}\subseteq M\$.
<a href="Shelah"
class="mw-redirect" title="Shelah">Shelah for supercompactness</a>
cardinals are a natural weakening of almost high-jump cardinals which
allows to have one embedding per \$f:\kappa\to\kappa\$ rather than a
single embedding for all such \$f\$s.

\$\kappa\$ is high-jump *order \$\eta\$* (resp. almost high-jump *order
\$\eta\$*) if there exists a strictly increasing sequence of ordinals
\$\\\theta\_\alpha:\alpha\<\eta\\\$ such that for all \$\alpha\<\eta\$,
there exists a high-jump embedding (resp. almost high-jump embedding)
with critical point \$\kappa\$ and clearance \$\theta\_\alpha\$.
\$\kappa\$ is *super high-jump* (resp. *super almost high-jump*) if
there are high-jump embeddings (resp. almost high-jump embeddings) with
arbtirarily large clearance (i.e. it is "(almost) high-jump order Ord").

A high-jump cardinal \$\kappa\$ has *unbounded excess closure* if for
some clearance \$\theta\$, for all cardinals \$\lambda\geq\theta\$,
there is a high-jump measure on \$\mathcal{P}\_\kappa(\lambda)\$
generating an ultrapower embedding with clearance \$\theta\$.

The dual notion *high-jump-for-strongness*, where the closure condition
\$M^\theta\subseteq M\$ is weakened to \$V\_\theta\subseteq M\$, turns
out to be equivalent to
[superstrongness](Superstrong "Superstrong").

## Properties

Let \$j:V\to M\$ a nontrivial elementary embedding with critical point
\$\kappa\$ and clearance \$\theta\$. Then there is no
\$f:\kappa\to\kappa\$ such that \$j(f)(\kappa)=\theta\$. Also,
\$\kappa^{+}\leq cf(\theta)\leq 2^\kappa\$ (see
<a href="Cofinality"
class="mw-redirect" title="Cofinality">cofinality</a>) and
\$\beth^M\_\theta=\theta\$. Moreover, \$M\_\theta\prec M\_{j(\kappa)}\$
and \$M\_\theta\$ satisfies ZFC where \$M\_\theta=M\cap V\_\theta\$.

When \$\kappa\$ is almost high-jump, in both \$V\$ and \$M\$,
\$\theta^\kappa=\theta\$, also \$\theta\$ is
<a href="Singular"
class="mw-redirect" title="Singular">singular</a>. Moreover,
\$V\_\theta\prec M\_{j(\kappa)}\$ and \$V\_\theta\$ satisfies ZFC.

The following statements also holds:

- Suppose there is a almost high-jump cardinal. Then there are many
  cardinals below it that are Shelah for supercompactness. Also, in the
  model \$V\_\kappa\$ there are many supercompact cardinals.


- Every high-jump cardinal is almost high-jump, and has order
  \$\theta\$; in fact, in the models \$V\_\theta\$, \$V\_\kappa\$ and
  \$M\_{j(\kappa)}\$ there are many super almost high-jump cardinals.


- The existence of a high-jump cardinal with order \$\eta\$ implies that
  for every \$\gamma\<\eta\$, there exists a model in which that
  cardinal is high-jump with order \$\gamma\$. The same statement holds
  for almost high-jump cardinals.


- The existence of a high-jump cardinal with unbounded excess closure is
  equiconsistent with the existence of a cardinal \$\kappa\$ such that
  for all sufficiently large \$\lambda\$, there exists a high-jump
  measure on \$\mathcal{P}\_\kappa(\lambda\$).


- Suppose \$\kappa\$ is [almost
  huge](Huge "Huge"); then
  in the model \$V\_\kappa\$ there are many cardinals that are high-jump
  with unbounded excess closure.


- Suppose that there exists a pair of cardinals (\$\kappa\$, \$\theta\$)
  such that there is a high-jump embedding \$j:V\to M\$ with critical
  point \$\kappa\$ and clearance \$\theta\$ and such that
  \$M^{2^\theta}\subseteq M\$. Then the cardinal \$\kappa\$ is super
  high-jump in the model \$V\_\theta\$, and the cardinal \$\kappa\$ has
  high-jump order \$\theta\$ in \$V\$. Furthermore, there are many super
  high-jump cardinals in the models \$V\_\kappa\$, \$V\_\theta\$, and
  \$M\_{j(\kappa)}\$.


- The least high-jump cardinal is not \$\Sigma_2\$-reflecting. In
  particular, it is not supercompact and not even strong. The same is
  true for the least [almost
  huge](Huge "Huge")
  cardinal, the least
  [superstrong](Superstrong "Superstrong")
  cardinal, the least almost-high-jump cardinal, and the least
  Shelah-for-supercompactness cardinal.
