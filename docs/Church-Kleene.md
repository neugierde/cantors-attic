# The Church-Kleene ordinal, $\\omega\_1^{ck}$











The *Church-Kleene* ordinal $\\omega\_1^{ck}$ is the supremum of the
computable ordinals, where an ordinal $\\alpha$ is *computable* if there
is a computable relation $\\lhd$ on $\\mathbb{N}$ of order type
$\\alpha$, that is, such that
$\\langle\\alpha,\\lt\\rangle\\cong\\langle\\mathbb{N},\\lhd\\rangle$.

This ordinal is closed under all of the elementary ordinal arithmetic
operations, such as successor, addition, multiplication and
exponentiation.

The Church-Kleene ordinal is the least
[admissible](/Admissible "Admissible")
ordinal.

## Relativized Church-Kleene ordinal

The Church-Kleene idea easily relativizes to oracles, where for any real
$x$, we define $\\omega\_1^x$ to be the supremum of the $x$-computable
ordinals. This is also the least
[admissible](/Admissible "Admissible")
ordinal relative to $x$, and every countable successor admissible
ordinal is $\\omega\_1^x$ for some $x$.
