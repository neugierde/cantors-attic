title: The Church-Kleene ordinal, \$\omega_1^{ck}\$
permalink: Church-Kleene
---











The *Church-Kleene* ordinal \$\omega_1^{ck}\$ is the supremum of the
computable ordinals, where an ordinal \$\alpha\$ is *computable* if
there is a computable relation \$\lhd\$ on \$\mathbb{N}\$ of order type
\$\alpha\$, that is, such that
\$\langle\alpha,\lt\rangle\cong\langle\mathbb{N},\lhd\rangle\$.

This ordinal is closed under all of the elementary ordinal arithmetic
operations, such as successor, addition, multiplication and
exponentiation.

Depending on conventions, there are two possibilities for where
\\\omega_1^{ck}\\ appears on the hierarchy of admissible ordinals:

- The Church-Kleene ordinal is the least
  [admissible](Admissible "Admissible")
  ordinal. This is when [Kripke-Platek set
  theory](Kripke-Platek "Kripke-Platek")
  is considered to include the axiom of infinity, so
  \\L\_\omega\not\vDash\textrm{KP}\\.
- \\\omega\\ and \\\omega_1^{ck}\\ are the two smallest admissible
  ordinals. This is when [Kripke-Platek set
  theory](Kripke-Platek "Kripke-Platek")
  is not considered to include the axiom of infinity, so
  \\L\_\omega\vDash\textrm{KP}\\.

## Relativized Church-Kleene ordinal

The Church-Kleene idea easily relativizes to oracles, where for any real
\$x\$, we define \$\omega_1^x\$ to be the supremum of the
\$x\$-computable ordinals. This is also the least
[admissible](Admissible "Admissible")
ordinal relative to \$x\$, and every countable successor admissible
ordinal is \$\omega_1^x\$ for some \$x\$. Note that here, \\\omega_1^x\\
doesn't denote the set defined by a relativized definition of
\\\omega_1\\, like what \\\omega_1^L\\ often denotes.

Friedman, Jensen, and Sacks proved that any countable admissible ordinal
is of the form \\\omega_1^x\\ for some real \\x\\. (<a
