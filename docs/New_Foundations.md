**New Foundations** (NF) is a set theory that has the set of all sets
(the universal set), but allows only stratifiable formulas in
comprehension.

Stratifiable formulas are formulas with one binary relation \$\in\$ such
that one can assign a level to every set in the formula and if in the
formula appears \$A \in B\$ then \$A\$ has level one less then \$B\$.
\$A \subset B\$ is a shortcut for \$\forall x: x \in B \implies x \in
A\$, so it requires that \$A\$ and \$B\$ are assigned the same level.

NF consists only of the axiom of extensionality (two sets are equal if
they have the same elements) and the axiom scheme of comprehension for
stratified formulas with parameters (\$\\x: \Phi(x)\\\$ must exist if
\$\Phi\$ is such a formula). It can be finitely axiomatized, similarly
to <a href="NBG"
class="mw-redirect" title="NBG">NBG</a>.

One can prove the negation of the axiom of choice in it and from this
the axiom of infinity (Specker, 1953<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1063889/"
class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). It is not known to
prove consistency of
[ZFC](ZFC "ZFC") and ZFC
(or even large cardinal axioms) is not known to prove its consistency.

NF with classes is called **Mathematical Logic** (ML). The class of all
sets is a set, but e.g. the class of all well-founded sets and the class
of all sets that do not contain itself must be proper classes in NF/ML
and actually they cannot be sets even without any axioms (see [Russell's
paradox](Russell%27s_paradox "Russell's paradox")).

**New Foundations with urelements** (NFU) appears to be a slight
weakening of extensionality: it allows for urelements (objects that have
no elements but are distinct from the empty set), i.e. two objects
having the same elements must be equal only if they are not empty.

It is much weaker in consistency strength then ZFC, consistent with
choice and can be strengthened by adding the axiom of infinity as well
as other axioms like the axiom of Cantorian sets (every Cantorian set is
strongly Cantorian, i.e. if a set is equinumerous with the set of its
singletons (one-element subsets), then the function \$x \mapsto \\x\\\$
restricted to this set is a set â€“ note that the cardinality of the
universal set is larger then that of the set of all singletons and the
function \$x \mapsto \\x\\\$ with the universal set as its domain must
be a proper class). If NF is consistent, it probably can be strengthened
by such axioms too.

**Stratified Foundations** (SF) is a variant of NF with no
extensionality.<a
