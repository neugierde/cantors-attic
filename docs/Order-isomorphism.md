An order isomorphism is a particular type of isomorphism that preserves order.

We say that $f$ creates an isomorphism between two relational systems $( A , <\_A )$ and $( B , <\_B )$ if and only if $f$ creates a bijection between $A$ and $B$ and for all $x$ and $y$ in $A$, $x <\_A y \\leftrightarrow f(x) <\_B f(y)$

## Properties

Order-isomorphisms preserve ordering, so if $( A , <\_A )$ is strictly ordered, founded, or well-ordered, then $( B , <\_B )$ will be as well.

All well-ordered sets are isomorphic to a unique [ordinal](Ordinal "Ordinal").  If two ordinals are order-isomorphic with respect to membership, then they are equal.  Between two well-ordered sets $A$ and $B$, exactly 1 of the following will hold:

-    $A$ is order-isomorphic to $B$
-    $A$ is order-isomorphic to an initial segment of $B$
-    An initial segment of $A$ is order-isomorphic to $B$
