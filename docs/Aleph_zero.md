# Omega, $\\omega$






(Redirected from [Aleph
zero](/index.php?title=Aleph_zero&redirect=no "Aleph zero"))






  

The smallest infinite ordinal, often denoted $\\omega$ (omega), has the
order type of the natural numbers. As a [von Neumann
ordinal](/Ordinal "Ordinal"),
$\\omega$ is in fact equal to the set of natural numbers. Since
$\\omega$ is infinite, it is not equinumerous with any smaller ordinal,
and so it is an
<a href="/index.php?title=Initial_ordinal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Initial ordinal (page does not exist)">initial ordinal</a>,
that is, a
[cardinal](/Cardinal "Cardinal").
When considered as a cardinal, the ordinal $\\omega$ is denoted
$\\aleph\_0$. So while these two notations are intensionally
different---we use the term $\\omega$ when using this number as an
ordinal and $\\aleph\_0$ when using it as a cardinal---nevertheless in
the contemporary treatment of cardinals in ZFC as initial ordinals, they
are extensionally the same and refer to the same object.

  

## Countable sets

A set is *countable* if it can be put into bijective correspondence with
a subset of $\\omega$. This includes all finite sets, and a set is
*countably infinite* if it is countable and also infinite. Some famous
examples of countable sets include:

-   The natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}=\\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}$.
-   The integers $\\mathbb{Z}=\\{\\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\\ldots\\}$
-   The rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}=\\{\\frac{p}{q}\\mid
    p,q\\in\\mathbb{Z}, q\\neq 0\\}$
-   The real algebraic numbers $\\mathbb{A}$, consisting of all zeros of
    nontrivial polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}$

The union of countably many countable sets remains countable, although
in the general case this fact requires the

A set is

if it is not countable.
