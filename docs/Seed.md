If $j:V \\to M$ is an elementary embedding and $a \\in j(D)$ for some set $D$, then $a$ is a *seed* for the measure $\\mu$ on $D$ defined by $X \\in \\mu \\iff X \\subseteq D$ and $a \\in j(X)$.  In this case, we say that $a$ *generates* $\\mu$ via $j$.  If $b=j(f)(a)$ for some function $f \\in V$, then we say that $a$ *generates* $b$ via the embedding.  If every element of $M$ is generated by $a$, then we will say that $a$ generates all of $M$ or all of the embedding $j$.
