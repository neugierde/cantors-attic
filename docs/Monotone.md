Monotonicity is a property of functions.

A function $f$ is monotone if and only if when $x \\le y \\implies f(x) \\le f(y)$, for all $x$ and $y$ in the domain of $f$.

A function $f$ is strictly monotone if and only if, for all $x$ and $y$ in the domain of $f$, $x \\lt y \\implies f(x) \\lt f(y)$.  All strictly monotone functions are monotone, but not vice versa.

A function $f$ is called a strictly monotone ordinal function if and only if it is strictly monotone, its domain is an [ordinal](Ordinal "Ordinal") number, and its range is a subset of the ordinals.

## Properties

All strictly monotone functions are injective.

If $f$ is a strictly monotone ordinal function, then $x \\le f(x)$ for any $x$ in the domain of $f$.

If $f$ provides an [order-isomorphism](Order-isomorphism "Order-isomorphism") between an ordinal and a subset of the ordinals, then $f$ is strictly monotone.

## Examples of Monotone functions

-   The identity function is an example of a monotone function that is not strictly monotone.
-   The [aleph](Aleph "Aleph") function is a strictly monotone ordinal function.
-   The successor function (either cardinal or ordinal)
