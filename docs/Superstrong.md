Superstrong cardinals were first utilized by Hugh Woodin in 1981 as an upper bound of consistency strength for the [axiom of determinacy](Axiom_of_determinacy "Axiom of determinacy"). However, Shelah had then discovered that [Shelah](Shelah "Shelah") cardinals were a weaker bound that still sufficed to imply the consistency strength of $\\text{(ZF+)AD}$. After this, it was found that the existence of infinitely many [Woodin](Woodin "Woodin") cardinals was equiconsistent to $\\text{AD}$. Woodin-ness is a significant weakening of superstrongness.

## Definitions

There are, like all critical point variations on [measurable](Measurable "Measurable") cardinals, multiple equivalent definitions of superstrongness. In particular, there is an [elementary embedding](Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding") definition and an [extender](Extender "Extender") definition.

### Elementary Embedding Definition

A cardinal $\\kappa$ is **$n$-superstrong** (or $n$-fold superstrong when referring to the [$n$-fold variants](N-fold_variants "N-fold variants")) iff it is the critical point of some [elementary embedding](Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding") $j:V\\rightarrow M$ such that $M$ is a transitive class and $V\_{j^n(\\kappa)}\\subset M$ (in this case, $j^{n+1}(\\kappa):=j(j^n(\\kappa))$ and $j^0(\\kappa):=\\kappa$).

A cardinal is **superstrong** iff it is $1$-superstrong.

The definition quite clearly shows that $\\kappa$ is $j^n(\\kappa)$-[strong](Strong "Strong"). However, the least superstrong cardinal is never strong.

$j^k(\\kappa)$ for $1 \\le k \\le n$ are called targets.{% cite Kentaro2007 %}

### Extender Definition

A cardinal $\\kappa$ is **$n$-superstrong** (or $n$-fold superstrong) iff there is a [$(\\kappa,\\beta)$-extender](Extender "Extender") $\\mathcal{E}$ for a $\\beta>\\kappa$ with $V\_{j^n\_{\\mathcal{E}}(\\kappa)}\\subseteq$ [$Ult\_{\\mathcal{E}}(V)$](Ultrapower "Ultrapower") (where $j\_{\\mathcal{E}}$ is the canonical ultrapower embedding from $V$ into $Ult\_{\\mathcal{E}}(V)$).

A cardinal is **superstrong** iff it is $1$-superstrong.

## Relation to other large cardinal notions

The consistency strength of $n$-superstrongness follows the [double helix pattern](N-fold_variants "N-fold variants") {% cite Kentaro2007 %}. Specifically:
-   [measurable](Measurable "Measurable") = $0$-superstrong = [almost $0$-huge](Huge "Huge") = $0$-huge
-   $n$-superstrong
-   $n$-fold supercompact
-   $(n+1)$-fold strong, $n$-fold extendible
-   $(n+1)$-fold Woodin, $n$-fold Vopěnka
-   $(n+1)$-fold Shelah
-   almost $n$-huge
-   super almost $n$-huge
-   $n$-huge
-   super $n$-huge
-   $(n+1)$-superstrong

Let $M$ be a transitive class $M$ such that there exists an elementary embedding $j:V\\to M$ with $V\_{j(\\kappa)}\\subseteq M$, and let $\\kappa$ be its superstrong critical point. While $j(\\kappa)$ need not be an inaccessible cardinal in $V$, it is always [worldly](Worldly "Worldly") and the rank model $V\_{j(\\kappa)}$ satisfies $\\text{ZFC+}$"$\\kappa$ is strong" (although $\\kappa$ may not be strong in $V$).

Superstrong cardinals have strong upward reflection properties, in particular there are many [measurable](Measurable "Measurable") cardinals *above* a superstrong cardinal. Every $n$-huge cardinal is $n$-superstrong, and so $n$-huge cardinals also have strong reflection properties. Remark however that if $\\kappa$ is [strong](Strong "Strong") or [supercompact](Supercompact "Supercompact"), then it is consistent that there is no inaccessible cardinals larger than $\\kappa$: this is because if $\\lambda>\\kappa$ is inaccessible, then $V\_\\lambda$ satisfies $\\kappa$'s strongness/supercompactness. Thus it is clear that supercompact cardinals need not be superstrong, even though they have higher consistency strength. In fact, because of the downward reflection properties of strong/supercompact cardinals, if there is a superstrong above a strong/supercompact $\\kappa$, then there are $\\kappa$-many superstrong cardinals below $\\kappa$; same with hugeness instead of superstrongness. In particular, the least superstrong is strictly smaller than the least strong (and thus smaller than the least supercompact).

-   $n$-fold supercompactness implies $n$-fold “super”-superstrongness ($n$-superstrongness with arbitrary large first target).{% cite Kentaro2007 %}
-   Every [$1$-extendible](Extendible "Extendible") cardinal is superstrong and has a [normal measure](Filter "Filter") containing all of the superstrongs less than said $1$-extendible. This means that the set of all superstronges less than it is [stationary](Stationary "Stationary"). Similarly, every cardinal $\\kappa$ which is [$2^\\kappa$-supercompact](Supercompact "Supercompact") is larger than the least superstrong cardinal and has a normal measure containing all of the superstrongs less than it.
-   Every superstrong cardinal is [Woodin](Woodin "Woodin") and has a normal measure containing all of the Woodin cardinals less than it. Thus the set of all Woodin cardinals below it is stationary, and so is the set of all measurables smaller than it.
-   If $κ$ is superstrong, then it is [Shelah](Shelah "Shelah") and there are $κ$ Shelah cardinals below it.{% cite Golshani2017 %}
-   Superstrongness is consistency-wise stronger than [hyper-Woodinness](Woodin "Woodin").{% cite Schimmerling2002 %}
-   If there is a superstrong cardinal, then in [$L(\\mathbb{R})$](Constructible_universe "Constructible universe"), the [axiom of determinacy](Axiom_of_determinacy "Axiom of determinacy") holds. {% cite Jech2003 %}
-   Letting $\\kappa$ be superstrong, $\\kappa$ can be [forced](Forcing "Forcing") to $\\aleph\_2$ with an $\\omega$-distributive, $\\kappa$-c.c. notion of forcing, and in this forcing extension there is a normal $\\omega\_2$-saturated ideal on $\\omega\_1$. {% cite Jech2003 %}
-   Superstrongness is not Laver [indestructible](Indestructible "Indestructible"). {% cite BagariaHamkinsTsaprounisUsuba %}
-   If [$\\mathrm{I}\_4^1(\\kappa)$](I4 "I4"), then $\\kappa$ is superstrong and $\\{\\alpha\\lt\\kappa|\\alpha\\text{ is superstrong}\\}$ has measure 1.{% cite Corazza2003 %}

A cardinal $κ$ is **[$C^{(n)}$-superstrong](Correct "Correct")** iff there exists an elementary embedding $j : V → M$ for transitive $M$, with $crit(j) = κ$, $V\_{j(κ)} ⊆ M$ and $j(κ) ∈ C^{(n)}$.{% cite Bagaria2012 %}
-   Every $C^{(n)}$-superstrong cardinal belongs to $C^{(n)}$.
-   Every superstrong cardinal is $C^{(1)}$-superstrong.
-   For every $n ≥ 1$, if $κ$ is $C^{(n+1)}$-superstrong, then there is a $κ$-complete normal [ultrafilter](Ultrafilter "Ultrafilter") $U$ over $κ$ such that $\\{α < κ : α$ is $C^{(n)}$-superstrong$\\} ∈ U$. Hence, the first $C^{(n)}$-superstrong cardinal, if it exists, is not $C^{(n+1)}$-superstrong.
-   If $κ$ is $2^κ$-[supercompact](Supercompact "Supercompact") and belongs to $C^{(n)}$, then there is a $κ$-complete normal ultrafilter $U$ over $κ$ such that the set of $C^{(n)}$-superstrong cardinals smaller than $κ$ belongs to $U$.
-   If $κ$ is $κ+1$-$C^{(n)}$-[extendible](Extendible "Extendible") and belongs to $C^{(n)}$, then $κ$ is $C^{(n)}$-superstrong and there is a $κ$-complete normal ultrafilter $U$ over $κ$ such that the set of $C^{(n)}$-superstrong cardinals smaller than $κ$ belongs to $U$.
-   Every $C^{(n)}$-[almost-huge](Huge "Huge") cardinal is $C^{(n)}$-superstrong.
-   Assuming [$\\mathrm{I3}(κ, δ)$](Rank_into_rank "Rank into rank"), if $δ$ is a limit cardinal (instead of a successor of a limit cardinal – Kunen’s Theorem excludes other cases), it is equal to $sup\\{j^m(κ) : m ∈ ω\\}$ where $j$ is the elementary embedding. Then $κ$ and $j^m(κ)$ are $C^{(n)}$-superstrong (inter alia) in $V\_δ$, for all $n$ and $m$.
