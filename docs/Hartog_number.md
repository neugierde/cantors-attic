The **Hartog number** of a set $X$ is the least [ordinal](Ordinal "Ordinal") which cannot be mapped injectively into $X$. For well-ordered sets $X$ the Hartog number is exactly $|X|^+$, the [successor cardinal](Cardinal#Successor\_cardinals "Cardinal#Successor\_cardinals") of $|X|$.

When assuming the negation of the [axiom of choice](Axiom_of_Choice "Axiom of Choice") some sets cannot be well-ordered, and the Hartog number measures how well-ordered they can be.

## Properties

-    $X$ can be well ordered if and only if $|X|$ is comparable with its Hartog number.
-    There *can* be a surjection from $X$ onto its Hartog number.
