## Definition

A set is transitive if and only if all of its elements are subsets of
it.

Equivalently, a set \$A\$ is transitive if and only if:

- it contains its union
- the powerset of \$A\$ contains \$A\$
- all members of the members of \$A\$ are members of \$A\$

## Properties of Transitive Sets

If \$A\$ is transitive, then if \$x\$ and \$A\$ are connected somehow by
membership (that is, \$x \in y \in z \ldots \in A\$), then \$x \in A\$.

The intersection of two transitive sets is transitive.

In set theory, transitive sets play an important role in models of ZFC.
