The assertion *$\\text{Ord}$ is Mahlo* is the scheme expressing that the
proper class
<a href="index.php?title=REG&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="REG (page does not exist)">REG</a>
consisting of all regular cardinals is a
<a href="Stationary" class="mw-redirect" title="Stationary">stationary</a>
proper class, meaning that it has elements from every definable (with
parameters)
<a href="index.php?title=Closed_unbounded&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Closed unbounded (page does not exist)">closed unbounded</a>
proper class of ordinals. In other words, the scheme asserts for every
formula $\\varphi$, that if for some parameter $z$ the class
$\\{α\\mid \\varphi(α,z)\\}$ is a closed unbounded class of
ordinals, then it contains a regular cardinal.

-   If $κ$ is
    [Mahlo](Mahlo "Mahlo"),
    then $V\_κ\\models\\text{Ord is Mahlo}$.
-   Consequently, the existence of a Mahlo cardinal implies the
    consistency of $\\text{Ord}$ is Mahlo, and the two notions are not
    equivalent.
-   Moreoever, since the ORD is Mahlo scheme is expressible as a
    first-order theory, it follows that whenever $V\_\\gamma\\prec
    V\_κ$, then also $V\_\\gamma$ satisfies the Levy scheme.
-   Consequently, if there is a Mahlo cardinal, then there is a club of
    cardinals $\\gamma\\ltκ$ for which
    $V\_\\gamma\\models\\text{Ord is Mahlo}$.

A simple compactness argument establishes that $\\text{Ord}$ is Mahlo is
equiconsistent over $\\text{ZFC}$ with the existence of an
<a href="Inaccessible_reflecting_cardinal" class="mw-redirect" title="Inaccessible reflecting cardinal">inaccessible reflecting cardinal</a>.
On the one hand, if $κ$ is an inaccessible reflecting cardinal,
then since $V\_κ\\prec V$ it follows that any class club definable
in $V$ with parameters below $κ$ will be unbounded in $κ$
and hence contain $κ$ as an element and consequently contain an
inaccessible cardinal. On the other hand, if $\\text{Ord}$ is Mahlo is
consistent, then every finite fragment of the theory asserting that
$κ$ is an inaccessible reflecting cardinal (which is after all
asserted as a scheme) is consistent, and hence by compactness the whole
theory is consistent.

If there is a pseudo
[uplifting](Uplifting "Uplifting")
(proof in that article) cardinal, or indeed, merely a pseudo
$0$-uplifting cardinal, then there is a transitive set model of ZFC with
a
[reflecting](Reflecting "Reflecting")
cardinal and consequently also a transitive model of ZFC plus
$\\text{Ord}$ is
Mahlo. {% cite Hamkins2014 %}
