# Russell's Paradox











  
Russell's paradox is the most elementary contradiction that results from
naive set theory. It is an immediate consequence of a schema of
unrestricted comprehension (where all classes become sets). It, in part,
justifies the exploration of axiomatic systems such as
[ZFC](/ZFC "ZFC"). It was
first discovered by Bertrand Russell when reviewing Frege's "Die
Grunderland der Arithmetik".

## Statement of the paradox

Take the set of all sets that are not elements of themselves. Given the
schema of unrestricted comprehension, any class is a member of this
class if and only if it is not a member of itself. Therefore, this class
is a member of itself if and only if it is not a member of itself,
creating a contradiction.
