# Dedekind finite











Let $X$ be a set, we say that $X$ is an *Dedekind infinite* set if there
exists $Y\\subsetneqq X$ and $f:X\\to Y$ which is a bijection, otherwise
we say that $X$ is *Dedekind finite*.

Every finite set is Dedekind finite, however the assertion that every
infinite set is Dedekind infinite requires *some*
<a href="Axiom_of_Choice" class="mw-redirect" title="Axiom of Choice">choice</a>.
It follows from the assertion that every countable family of non-empty
sets has a choice function. In particular, $X$ is Dedekind infinite if
and only if $\\aleph\_0\\le\|X\|$.

## Classes of Dedekind finite sets

There are several classes of Dedekind finite sets: (in this context
ordered means linearly ordered)

1.  $\\omega$, the set of finite cardinals.
2.  $\\Delta\_1 = \\{x\\mid x=y+z\\rightarrow y\\in\\omega\\lor
    z\\in\\omega\\}$, all those cardinals that cannot be written as the
    disjoint union of infinite sets (also known as
    <a href="index.php?title=Amorphous&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Amorphous (page does not exist)">amorphous</a>
    sets).
3.  $\\Delta\_2 = \\{x\\mid\\text{ Every ordered partition of }x\\text{
    is finite}$, all those that cannot be mapped surjectively onto an
    infinite ordered set.
4.  $\\Delta\_3 = \\{x\\mid y\\subseteq x\\text{ can be
    ordered}\\Leftrightarrow \|y\|\\in\\omega\\}$, all those that have
    no injection from an infinite ordered set.
5.  $\\Delta\_4 = \\{x\\mid \\omega\\nleq^\\ast x\\}$, all those that
    cannot be mapped surjectively onto $\\omega$.
6.  $\\Delta\_5 = \\{x\\mid x+1\\nleq^\\ast x\\}$, all the cardinals
    that cannot be surjectively mapped onto a finitely larger set.
7.  $\\Delta = \\{x\\mid \\omega\\nleq x\\}$, all the Dedekind finite
    cardinals.

In \[Tru74\] the relations between the different classes is established,
as well various consistency results regrading combinations of these
classes.

Various types of infinite Dedekind finite sets are used to counter many
implications between different choice principles. For example:

-   By adding a Dedekind finite set of real numbers it is possible to
    show that the ultrafilter lemma holds; that every set can be
    linearly ordered; every set can be mapped onto $\\omega$; however
    the axiom of choice fails (for countable families).
-   By adding an amorphous set one shows that it is possible to have
    that not every set can be linearly ordered.
