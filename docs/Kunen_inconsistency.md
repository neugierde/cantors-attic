The Kunen inconsistency, the theorem showing that there can be no nontrivial [elementary embedding](Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding") from the universe to itself, remains a focal point of large cardinal set theory, marking a hard upper bound at the summit of the main ascent of the large cardinal hierarchy, the first outright refutation of a large cardinal axiom. On this main ascent, large cardinal axioms assert the existence of elementary embeddings $j:V\\to M$ where $M$ exhibits increasing affinity with $V$ as one climbs the hierarchy. The $\\theta$-[strong](Strong "Strong") cardinals, for example, have $V\_\\theta\\subset M$; the $\\lambda$-[supercompact](Supercompact "Supercompact") cardinals have $M^\\lambda\\subset M$; and the [huge](Huge "Huge") cardinals have $M^{j(\\kappa)}\\subset M$. The natural limit of this trend, first suggested by Reinhardt, is a nontrivial elementary embedding $j:V\\to V$, the critical point of which is accordingly known as a *[Reinhardt](Reinhardt "Reinhardt")* cardinal. Shortly after this idea was introduced, however, Kunen famously proved that there are no such embeddings, and hence no Reinhardt cardinals in $\\text{ZFC}$. 

Since that time, the inconsistency argument has been generalized by various authors, including Harada

-   There is no nontrivial elementary embedding $j:V\\to V$ from the set-theoretic universe to itself.
-   There is no nontrivial elementary embedding $j:V[G]\\to V$ of a set-forcing extension of the universe to the universe, and neither is there  $j:V\\to V[G]$ in the converse direction.
-   More generally, there is no nontrivial elementary embedding between two ground models of the universe.
-   More generally still, there is no nontrivial elementary embedding $j:M\\to N$ when both $M$ and $N$ are eventually stationary correct.
-   There is no nontrivial elementary embedding $j:V\\to \\text{HOD}$, and neither is there $j:V\\to M$ for a variety of other definable classes, including $\\text{gHOD}$ and the $\\text{HOD}^\\eta$, $\\text{gHOD}^\\eta$.
-   If $j:V\\to M$ is elementary, then $V=\\text{HOD}(M)$.
-   There is no nontrivial elementary embedding $j:\\text{HOD}\\to V$.
-   More generally, for any definable class $M$, there is no nontrivial elementary embedding $j:M\\to V$.
-   There is no nontrivial elementary embedding $j:\\text{HOD}\\to\\text{HOD}$ that is definable in $V$ from parameters.

It is not currently known whether the Kunen inconsistency may be undertaken in ZF. Nor is it known whether one may rule out nontrivial embeddings $j:\\text{HOD}\\to\\text{HOD}$ even in $\\text{ZFC}$.

## Metamathematical issues

Kunen formalized his theorem in Kelly-Morse set theory, but it is also possible to prove it in the weaker system of G&ouml;del-Bernays set theory. In each case, the embedding $j$ is a $\\text{GBC}$ class, and elementary of $j$ is asserted as a $\\Sigma\_1$-elementary embedding, which implies $\\Sigma\_n$-elementarity when the two models have the ordinals.
