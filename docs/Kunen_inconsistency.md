The Kunen inconsistency, the theorem showing that there can be no
nontrivial [elementary
embedding](Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding")
from the universe to itself, remains a focal point of large cardinal set
theory, marking a hard upper bound at the summit of the main ascent of
the large cardinal hierarchy, the first outright refutation of a large
cardinal axiom. On this main ascent, large cardinal axioms assert the
existence of elementary embeddings $j:V\\to M$ where $M$ exhibits
increasing affinity with $V$ as one climbs the hierarchy. The
$\\theta$-[strong](Strong "Strong")
cardinals, for example, have $V\_\\theta\\subset M$; the
$\\lambda$-[supercompact](Supercompact "Supercompact")
cardinals have $M^\\lambda\\subset M$; and the
[huge](Huge "Huge")
cardinals have $M^{j(\\kappa)}\\subset M$. The natural limit of this
trend, first suggested by Reinhardt, is a nontrivial elementary
embedding $j:V\\to V$, the critical point of which is accordingly known
as a
*[Reinhardt](Reinhardt "Reinhardt")*
cardinal. Shortly after this idea was introduced, however, Kunen
famously proved that there are no such embeddings, and hence no
Reinhardt cardinals in $\\text{ZFC}$.

Since that time, the inconsistency argument has been generalized by
various authors, including Harada

-   There is no nontrivial elementary embedding $j:V\\to V$ from the
    set-theoretic universe to itself.
-   There is no nontrivial elementary embedding $j:V\[G\]\\to V$ of a
    set-forcing extension of the universe to the universe, and neither
    is there $j:V\\to V\[G\]$ in the converse direction.
-   More generally, there is no nontrivial elementary embedding between
    two ground models of the universe.
-   More generally still, there is no nontrivial elementary embedding
    $j:M\\to N$ when both $M$ and $N$ are eventually stationary correct.
-   There is no nontrivial elementary embedding $j:V\\to \\text{HOD}$,
    and neither is there $j:V\\to M$ for a variety of other definable
    classes, including $\\text{gHOD}$ and the $\\text{HOD}^\\eta$,
    $\\text{gHOD}^\\eta$.
-   If $j:V\\to M$ is elementary, then $V=\\text{HOD}(M)$.
-   There is no nontrivial elementary embedding $j:\\text{HOD}\\to V$.
-   More generally, for any definable class $M$, there is no nontrivial
    elementary embedding $j:M\\to V$.
-   There is no nontrivial elementary embedding
    $j:\\text{HOD}\\to\\text{HOD}$ that is definable in $V$ from
    parameters.

It is not currently known whether the Kunen inconsistency may be
undertaken in ZF. Nor is it known whether one may rule out nontrivial
embeddings $j:\\text{HOD}\\to\\text{HOD}$ even in $\\text{ZFC}$.

## Metamathematical issues

Kunen formalized his theorem in Kelly-Morse set theory, but it is also
possible to prove it in the weaker system of Gödel-Bernays set theory.
In each case, the embedding $j$ is a $\\text{GBC}$ class, and elementary
of $j$ is asserted as a $\\Sigma\_1$-elementary embedding, which implies
$\\Sigma\_n$-elementarity when the two models have the ordinals.
