# Critical point











## Critical Point

Given two structures $\\mathcal{M}$ and $\\mathcal{N}$, loosely
speaking, the *critical point* is the smallest element in $\\mathcal{M}$
which is similar to a larger element in $\\mathcal{N}$. The actual
definition can only be told if both structures' universes are transitive
classes containing ordinals.

## Formal Definition

Given two transitive classes $\\mathcal{M}$ and $\\mathcal{N}$, and an
elementary embedding $j:\\mathcal{M}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{N}$, the
critical point of $j$ (often denoted $\\mathrm{cp}(j)$) is the smallest
ordinal $\\alpha$ in $\\mathrm{M}$ such that $\\alpha\\neq j(\\alpha)$.

## Use in Large Cardinal Axioms

Critical points are used in Large Cardinal Axioms to make very large
$\\mathrm{M}$ such that $j:V\\rightarrow\\mathcal{M}$ is an elementary
embedding. The closer $\\mathcal{M}$ gets to $V$, the closer one is to
proving the Wholeness Axiom. Assuming this embedding has a critical
point, one gets closer to a

cardinal, which is inconsistent with the Axiom of Choice. Thus, the
following axioms mention critical points:

    cardinals (axioms I0-I3)
-   The [wholeness
    axiom](Wholeness_axiom "Wholeness axiom")
-   Huge cardinals:
    -   [almost
        n-huge](Huge "Huge")
    -   [almost
        super-n-huge](Huge "Huge")
    -   [n-huge](Huge "Huge")
    -   [super-n-huge](Huge "Huge")
    -   [$\\omega$-huge](Huge "Huge")
-   High jump cardinals:
    -   [almost
        high-jump](High-jump "High-jump")
    -   [high-jump](High-jump "High-jump")
    -   [super
        high-jump](High-jump "High-jump")
    -   [high-jump with unbounded excess
        closure](High-jump "High-jump")
-   [$\\alpha$-extendible](Extendible "Extendible")
