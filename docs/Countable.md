# Countable and uncountable sets











  
A set is *countable* when it is equinumerous with a subset of $\\omega$.
This includes all finite sets, including the empty set, and the infinite
countable sets are said to be *countably infinite*. An
<a href="Uncountable" class="mw-redirect" title="Uncountable">uncountable</a>
set is a set that is not countable. The existence of uncountable sets is
a consequence of Cantor's observationt that the set of reals is
uncountable.

  

## Uncountability of the reals

Cantor's diagonal argument shows that the set of reals is uncountable.

## Uncountability of power sets

More generally, the power set of any set is a set of strictly larger
cardinality.
