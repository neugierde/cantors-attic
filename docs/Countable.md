A set is *countable* when it is equinumerous with a subset of $\\omega$. This includes all finite sets, including the empty set, and the infinite countable sets are said to be *countably infinite*. An [uncountable](Uncountable "Uncountable") set is a set that is not countable. The existence of uncountable sets is a consequence of Cantor's observationt that the set of reals is uncountable.


## Uncountability of the reals

Cantor's diagonal argument shows that the set of reals is uncountable.

## Uncountability of power sets

More generally, the power set of any set is a set of strictly larger cardinality.
