Zero, or $0$, is the smallest [ordinal](Ordinal "Ordinal") and [cardinal](Cardinal "Cardinal") number.  It is usually represented by the [empty set](Empty_set "Empty set"), denoted $\\varnothing$ or $\\{\\}$.

Given an ordinal (or cardinal) $x$:
-    $x + 0 = 0 + x = x$.
-    $x \\cdot 0 = 0 \\cdot x = 0$
-    $x^0 = 1$
    -    Because there is exactly one function from the empty set to any set (including the empty set) — the [empty function](Empty\_set#As\_a\_Function.5CRelation "Empty\_set#As\_a\_Function.5CRelation").
-    $0^x = 0$ if $x > 0$
    -    Because there are no functions from a nonempty set to the empty set.

Most set theorists classify zero as the only ordinal which is neither a [limit ordinal](Limit_ordinal "Limit ordinal") nor the [successor](Successor_ordinal "Successor ordinal") of any ordinal. Some set theorists (e.g. Thomas Jech) instead classify zero as a [limit ordinal](Limit_ordinal "Limit ordinal"), because like other limit ordinals, it is the limit of all ordinals less than it (of which there are none).
