The ordinal $\\epsilon\_0$, commonly given the British pronunciation
"epsilon naught," is the smallest ordinal $\\alpha$ for which
$\\alpha=\\omega^\\alpha$ and can be equivalently characterized as the
supremum

$$\\epsilon\_0=\\sup\\{\\omega,\\omega^{\\omega},\\omega^{\\omega^{\\omega}},\\ldots\\}$$

The [ordinals below
$\\epsilon\_0$](Small_countable_ordinals "Small countable ordinals")
exhibit an attractive finitistic normal form of representation, arising
from an iterated Cantor normal form involving only finite numbers and
the expression $\\omega$ in finitely iterated exponentials, products and
sums.

The ordinal $\\epsilon\_0$ arises in diverse proof-theoretic contexts.
For example, it is the proof-theoretic ordinal of the first-order Peano
axioms.

## Epsilon numbers

The ordinal $\\epsilon\_0$ is the first ordinal in the hierarchy of
$\\epsilon$-numbers, where $\\epsilon\_\\alpha$ is the $\\alpha^{\\rm
th}$ fixed point of the exponential function
$\\beta\\mapsto\\omega^\\beta$. These can also be defined inductively,
as
$\\epsilon\_{\\alpha+1}=\\sup\\{\\epsilon\_\\alpha+1,\\omega^{\\epsilon\_\\alpha+1},\\omega^{\\omega^{\\epsilon\_\\alpha+1}},\\ldots\\}$,
and $\\epsilon\_\\lambda=\\sup\_{\\alpha\\lt\\lambda}\\epsilon\_\\alpha$
for limit ordinals $\\lambda$. The epsilon numbers therefore form an
increasing continuous sequence of ordinals. Every uncountable infinite
cardinal $\\kappa$ is an epsilon number fixed point
$\\kappa=\\epsilon\_\\kappa$.
