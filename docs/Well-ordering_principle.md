The well-ordering principle states that every set is well-ordered by some relation.  It is an equivalent of the [axiom of choice](Axiom_of_choice "Axiom of choice").

## Example
For example, the well-ordering principle states that $\\mathbb R$, the set of reals, is well-ordered. This can be done in a very nonconstructive way:

Let $f:\\mathbb R\\rightarrow\\beth\_1$ be a bijection. Then, define $R=\\{(a,b):f(a)< f(b)\\}$. Because $f$ preserves order between $(\\mathbb R,R)$ and $(\\beth\_1,<)$ by definition of $R$, then $R$ must be a well-ordering of $\\mathbb R$.

The instance of the axiom of choice here is in the choice of $f$. (Elaborate?)
