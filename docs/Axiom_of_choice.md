The *axiom of choice* (AC) is an axiom, usually adjoined to the Zermelo-Frenkael ([ZF](ZF "ZF")) axioms of set theory. With this axiom the theory is known as [ZFC](ZFC "ZFC"). ZF and ZFC are equiconsistent.

Informally the axiom of choice says that given a family of non-empty sets we have a function selecting exactly one element from each set.

## Equivalent formulations
The axiom has many equivalents, including but not limited to:
-    The assertion that all the infinite cardinals are [$\\aleph$-numbers](Aleph "Aleph").
-    The well-ordering principle, which states that every set can be well-ordered.
-    Zorn's lemma, stating that if the union of any chain in $x$ is itself a member of $x$, then $x$ must have some maximal element, with respect to inclusion.
-    Cantor's Law of Trichotomy, the statement that any two sets are comparable with respect to cardinality, that is, $|A|\\lt|B| \\lor |A|=|B| \\lor |B|\\lt|A|$

## Weaker forms
Among weaker form are the axiom of dependent choice (AD) and the axiom of countable choice ($\\text{AC}\_\\omega$).

## Statements inconsistent with AC
[Cardinals without the axiom of choice](Cardinal_general "Cardinal general") cannot all be equated with initial ordinals. Some sets cannot be well-ordered, and the [Hartog number](Hartog_number "Hartog number") measures how well-ordered they can be. There can be e.g. infinite [Dedekind finite](Dedekind_finite "Dedekind finite") cardinals and amorphous sets.

[Reinhardt](Reinhardt "Reinhardt") cardinals and [Berkeley](Berkeley "Berkeley") cardinals are known to be inconsistent with ZFC, but not known to be inconsistent with ZF.

[Axiom of determinacy](Axiom_of_determinacy "Axiom of determinacy") is inconsistent with AC too.

Without the axiom of choice $\\omega\_1$ can be e.g. [measurable](Measurable "Measurable") (this is even consistent with dependent choice), [strongly compact](Strongly_compact "Strongly compact"), [supercompact](Supercompact "Supercompact")([Jech 1968](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02771215), Takeuti, 1970, after [https://eprints.illc.uva.nl/id/eprint/689/1/X-2013-02.text.pdf]) or [huge](Huge "Huge") ([Mignone 1990](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/rocky-mountain-journal-of-mathematics/volume-20/issue-1/The-relative-consistency-of-a-large-cardinal-property-for-%cf%89/10.1216/rmjm/1181073173.full)). More generally, e.g., if $κ$ is a weakly compact cardinal and $η < κ$ is a regular cardinal then there is a symmetric model in which $η^+$ is weakly compact (as Jech, 1968 showed). This applies to large cardinal notions preserved under small symmetric forcing, like measurability, [weak compactness](Weakly_compact "Weakly compact") or [Ramsey](Ramsey "Ramsey")ness, but not to [Erdős](Erdős "Erdős") cardinals (the partition property $κ → (α)^{<ω}\_2$ is preserved, but the requirement that they are minimal such that a partition property holds is not necessarily preserved).
