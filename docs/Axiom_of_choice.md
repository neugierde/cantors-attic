choice</a>*

The *axiom of choice* (AC) is an axiom, usually adjoined to the
Zermelo-Frenkael
(<a href="ZF"
class="mw-redirect" title="ZF">ZF</a>) axioms of set theory. With this
axiom the theory is known as
[ZFC](ZFC "ZFC"). ZF and
ZFC are equiconsistent.

Informally the axiom of choice says that given a family of non-empty
sets we have a function selecting exactly one element from each set.

## Equivalent formulations

The axiom has many equivalents, including but not limited to:

- The assertion that all the infinite cardinals are
  [\$\aleph\$-numbers](Aleph "Aleph").
- The well-ordering principle, which states that every set can be
  well-ordered.
- Zorn's lemma, stating that if the union of any chain in \$x\$ is
  itself a member of \$x\$, then \$x\$ must have some maximal element,
  with respect to inclusion.
- Cantor's Law of Trichotomy, the statement that any two sets are
  comparable with respect to cardinality, that is, \$\|A\|\lt\|B\| \lor
  \|A\|=\|B\| \lor \|B\|\lt\|A\|\$

## Weaker forms

Among weaker form are the axiom of dependent choice (AD) and the axiom
of countable choice (\$\text{AC}\_\omega\$).

## Statements inconsistent with AC

[Cardinals without the axiom of
choice](Cardinal_general "Cardinal general")
cannot all be equated with initial ordinals. Some sets cannot be
well-ordered, and the [Hartog
number](Hartog_number "Hartog number")
measures how well-ordered they can be. There can be e.g. infinite
[Dedekind
finite](Dedekind_finite "Dedekind finite")
cardinals and amorphous sets.

[Reinhardt](Reinhardt "Reinhardt")
cardinals and
[Berkeley](Berkeley "Berkeley")
cardinals are known to be inconsistent with ZFC, but not known to be
inconsistent with ZF.

[Axiom of
determinacy](Axiom_of_determinacy "Axiom of determinacy")
is inconsistent with AC too.

Without the axiom of choice \$\omega_1\$ can be e.g.
[measurable](Measurable "Measurable")
(this is even consistent with dependent choice), [strongly
compact](Strongly_compact "Strongly compact"),
[supercompact](Supercompact "Supercompact")(<a

class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. More generally,
e.g., if \$κ\$ is a weakly compact cardinal and \$η \< κ\$ is a regular
cardinal then there is a symmetric model in which \$η^+\$ is weakly
compact (as Jech, 1968 showed). This applies to large cardinal notions
preserved under small symmetric forcing, like measurability, [weak
compactness](Weakly_compact "Weakly compact")
or
[Ramseyness](Ramsey "Ramsey"),
but not to
<a href="Erd%C5%91s"
class="mw-redirect" title="Erdős">Erdős</a> cardinals (the partition
property \$κ → (α)^{\<ω}\_2\$ is preserved, but the requirement that
they are minimal such that a partition property holds is not necessarily
preserved). (<a
