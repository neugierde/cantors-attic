# Googol











The number *googol* is the number $10^{100}$, represented in the decimal
system as follows:

10,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000.

The number was named by Milton Sirotta, the nine-year-old nephew of
American mathematician Edward Kasner, and popularized in Kasner's 1940
book *Mathematics and the imagination*.

### <span id="Googol_plex" class="mw-headline">Googol plex</span>

A *googol plex* is the number $10^{\\text{googol}}$, or $10^{10^{100}}$.
In general, an $x$-plex is $10^x$.

  

  

### <span id="Googol_bang" class="mw-headline">Googol bang</span>

A 'googol bang' is the factorial of a googol, that is, the number
$(10^{100})!$. In general, an "$x$-bang" means $x!$.

  

### <span id="Googol_stack" class="mw-headline">Googol stack</span>

A 'googol stack' is the number $10^{10^{10^{.^{.^.}}}}$, where the
number of levels in the stack is a googol. This can also be represented
$10\\uparrow\\uparrow\\text{googol}$ in the Knuth notation for iterated
exponentials.

  

### <span id="The_googol_plex_bang_stack_hierarchy" class="mw-headline">The googol plex bang stack hierarchy</span>

The plex, bang and stack vocabulary enables one to name some very large
numbers with ease, such as a *googol bang plex stack*, which is the
exponential tower $10^{10^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{^{10}}}}}$ of height
$10^{(10^{100})!}$, or a googol stack bang stack bang, and so on.

The *googol plex bang stack hierarchy* is the collection of numbers that
can be named in this scheme, by a term starting with googol and having
finitely many adjectival operands: bang, stack, plex, in any finite
pattern, repetitions allowed.

The initial segment of this hierarchy, using term with at most three
adjectival operands, appears below:

-   googol stack stack stack
-   googol bang stack stack
-   googol plex stack stack
-   googol stack bang stack
-   googol stack plex stack
-   googol stack stack bang
-   googol stack stack plex
-   googol stack stack
-   
-   all expressions involving at most one stack, and up to googol-2 many
    plexes and bangs appear here
-   
-   googol bang bang stack
-   googol bang plex stack
-   googol plex bang stack
-   googol plex plex stack
-   googol bang stack bang
-   googol bang stack plex
-   googol bang stack
-   googol plex stack bang
-   googol plex stack plex
-   googol plex stack
-   googol stack bang bang
-   googol stack bang plex
-   googol stack plex bang
-   googol stack plex plex
-   googol stack bang
-   googol stact plex
-   googol stack
-   
-   all terms involving up to googol-2 many bangs and plexes appear here
-   
-   googol bang bang bang
-   googol bang bang plex
-   googol bang plex bang
-   googol bang plex plex
-   googol plex bang bang
-   googol plex bang plex
-   googol plex plex bang
-   googol plex plex plex
-   googol bang bang
-   googol bang plex
-   googol plex bang
-   googol plex plex
-   googol bang
-   googol plex
-   googol

A sorting algorithm for all such names in the hierarchy involving fewer
than googol-2 many terms is provided by
