The number *googol* is the number $10^{100}$, represented in the decimal system as follows:

10,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000,&shy;000.

The number was named by Milton Sirotta, the nine-year-old nephew of American mathematician Edward Kasner, and popularized in Kasner's 1940 book *Mathematics and the imagination*.


### Googol plex

A *googol plex* is the number $10^{\\text{googol}}$, or $10^{10^{100}}$. In general, an $x$-plex is $10^x$.




### Googol bang

A 'googol bang' is the factorial of a googol, that is, the number $(10^{100})!$. In general, an "$x$-bang" means $x!$.


### Googol stack

A 'googol stack' is the number $10^{10^{10^{.^{.^.}}}}$, where the number of levels in the stack is a googol. This can also be represented $10\\uparrow\\uparrow\\text{googol}$ in the Knuth notation for iterated exponentials.


### The googol plex bang stack hierarchy

The plex, bang and stack vocabulary enables one to name some very large numbers with ease, such as a *googol bang plex stack*, which is the exponential tower $10^{10^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{^{10}}}}}$ of height $10^{(10^{100})!}$, or a googol stack bang stack bang, and so on.

The *googol plex bang stack hierarchy* is the collection of numbers that can be named in
this scheme, by a term starting with googol and having
finitely many adjectival operands: bang, stack, plex, in
any finite pattern, repetitions allowed.

The initial segment of this hierarchy, using term with at most three adjectival operands, appears below:

-    googol stack stack stack
-    googol bang stack stack
-    googol plex stack stack
-    googol stack bang stack
-    googol stack plex stack
-    googol stack stack bang
-    googol stack stack plex
-    googol stack stack
-  
-    all expressions involving at most one stack, and up to googol-2 many plexes and bangs appear here
-  
-    googol bang bang stack
-    googol bang plex stack
-    googol plex bang stack
-    googol plex plex stack
-    googol bang stack bang
-    googol bang stack plex
-    googol bang stack
-    googol plex stack bang
-    googol plex stack plex
-    googol plex stack
-    googol stack bang bang
-    googol stack bang plex
-    googol stack plex bang
-    googol stack plex plex
-    googol stack bang
-    googol stact plex
-    googol stack
-  
-    all terms involving up to googol-2 many bangs and plexes appear here
-   
-    googol bang bang bang
-    googol bang bang plex
-    googol bang plex bang
-    googol bang plex plex
-    googol plex bang bang
-    googol plex bang plex
-    googol plex plex bang
-    googol plex plex plex
-    googol bang bang
-    googol bang plex
-    googol plex bang
-    googol plex plex
-    googol bang
-    googol plex
-    googol

A sorting algorithm for all such names in the hierarchy involving fewer than googol-2 many terms is provided by
