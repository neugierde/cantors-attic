A **fundamental sequence for an ordinal $\\alpha$** is a sequence $(\\alpha[\\xi])\_{\\xi\\in\\beta}$ of some ordinal length, satisfying these properties:
-   $\\forall(\\xi\\in\\beta)(\\alpha[\\xi]\\in\\beta)$
-   $\\textrm{sup}\\{\\alpha[\\xi]:\\xi\\in\\beta\\}=\\alpha$<!--I think this is what "lim" means, given the context of Hardy's ordinal representation system-->
(Rathjen, [Proof Theory: From arithmetic to set theory](https://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~rathjen/Sepp-chiemsee.pdf#page=12))

The $\\xi$th entry of the fundamental sequence of $\\alpha$ is often denoted by $\\alpha[\\xi]$, but some authors have used other ways to denote it, such as $\\{\\alpha\\}(\\xi)$. (Freund, Pakhomov, [Short Proofs for Slow Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03251v2)<!--p.3-->)
