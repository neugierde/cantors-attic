The Busy Beaver function, also known as Rado's Sigma function is a function from computability theory. Denoted $\\Sigma(n)$ or $BB(n)$, it is defined as the maximum number of ones that can be written (in the finished tape) with an n-state, 2-color Turing machine, starting from a blank tape, before halting. It is one of the fastest-growing functions ever arising out of professional mathematics. The Busy Beaver function is an uncomputable function meaning that no algorithm that terminates after a finite number of steps can compute $\\Sigma(n)$ for an arbitrary n.

## Values

The first four values of the Busy Beaver function have been proven to be as follows:

$\\Sigma(1)=1$

$\\Sigma(2)=4$

$\\Sigma(3)=6$

$\\Sigma(4)=13$

Values beyond 4 are unknown, however, the following bounds have been discovered:

$\\Sigma(5)>4098$

$\\Sigma(6)>3.514 * 10^{18276}$

$\\Sigma(7)>10^{10^{10^{10^{18705352}}}}$

Beyond these numbers, the Busy Beaver function grows phenomenally fast. It has been shown that $\\Sigma(18)$ is larger than Graham's number.
The growth rate of the function is comparable to the [ Church-Kleene ordinal](Church-Kleene_ "Church-Kleene ") in the [fast-growing hierarchy](Fast-growing_hierarchy "Fast-growing hierarchy").
