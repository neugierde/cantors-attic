Core models are inner [model](Model "Model")s. The first core model, Dodd-Jensen core model ($K^{DJ}$), was introduced in {% cite DoddJensen1982 %}. The core model built assuming [$¬ 0 ^{sword}$](Zero_sword "Zero sword") is called *the core built using measures of order 0* ($K^{MOZ}$).{% cite SharpeWelch2011 %} The core model is often denoted $\\mathbf{K}$.

## From the definition
Definition 6.3:
-    $D = \\{ \\langle \\xi, \\kappa \\rangle : \\xi \\in C\_N, N\\textrm{ is a mouse at }\\kappa, |C\_N| = \\omega \\}$
-    $D\_\\alpha = \\{ \\langle \\xi, \\kappa \\rangle : \\xi \\in C\_N, N\\textrm{ is a mouse at }\\kappa, |C\_N| = \\omega, \\mathrm{Ord} \\cap N < \\omega\_\\alpha \\}$
-    $K = L[D]$ — **the core model**
-    $K\_\\alpha = |J\_\\alpha^D|$

Definition 5.4: $N$ is a *mouse* iff $N$ is a critical premouse, $N'$ is iterable and for each $i \\in \\mathrm{Ord}$ there is $N\_i$, a critical premouse, such that $(N\_i)' = N\_i'$ where
$\\langle N\_i', \\pi\_{ij}', \\kappa\_i \\rangle$ is the iteration of $N'$, and $n(N\_i) = n(N)$.

Definition 5.1: Premouse $N = J\_\\alpha^U$ is *critical* iff $\\mathcal{P}(\\kappa) \\cap \\Sigma\_\\omega(N) \\not\\subseteq N$ and $N$ is acceptable.

Definition 3.1: For $\\kappa < \\alpha$, $N = J\_\\alpha^U$ is a *premouse* at $\\kappa$ iff $N \\models \\text{“$U$ is a normal measure on $\\kappa$”}$.

$J\_\\alpha^A$ is defined using functions rudimentary in $A$ (definitions 1.1, 1.2).

## Properties
The core model $K$ is not absolute, for example: if $0^\\sharp$ does not exist, then $K = L$; if $0^\\sharp$ exists, but $0^{\\sharp\\sharp}$ does not, then $K = L[0^\\sharp]$. However, $K^M = M \\cap K$ for any inner model $M$.

$K$ will contain “all the sharps” in the universe, but may in general be larger than the model obtained by iterating the $\\sharp$ operation through the ordinals.
