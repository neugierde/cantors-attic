# Successor Ordinal











  
A successor ordinal, by definition, is an ordinal $\\alpha$ that is
equal to $\\beta + 1$ for some ordinal $\\beta$.

The successor function, denoted as $\\beta+1$, $\\operatorname{suc}
\\beta$, or $\\beta ^+$ is defined on the ordinals as $\\beta \\cup \\{
\\beta \\}$

## Properties of the successor

There are no ordinals between $\\beta$ and $\\beta + 1$.

The union $\\bigcup \\beta$ can be thought of as an inverse successor
function, because $\\bigcup ( \\beta + 1 ) = \\beta$. All [limit
ordinals](Limit_ordinal "Limit ordinal")
are equal to their union.
