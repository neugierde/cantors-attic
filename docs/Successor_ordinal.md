A successor ordinal, by definition, is an ordinal \$\alpha\$ that is
equal to \$\beta + 1\$ for some ordinal \$\beta\$.

The successor function, denoted as \$\beta+1\$, \$\operatorname{suc}
\beta\$, or \$\beta ^+\$ is defined on the ordinals as \$\beta \cup \\
\beta \\\$

## Properties of the successor

There are no ordinals between \$\beta\$ and \$\beta + 1\$.

The union \$\bigcup \beta\$ can be thought of as an inverse successor
function, because \$\bigcup ( \beta + 1 ) = \beta\$. All [limit
ordinals](Limit_ordinal "Limit ordinal")
are equal to their union.
