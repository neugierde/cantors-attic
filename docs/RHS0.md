RHS0 is a notation for large recursive ordinals devised by (who?). In contrast to many other notations in this range, it's described as a "combinatorial" notation, based on countably many symbols that represent operators that take precedence over each other in a certain way. It's based on lambda calculus, and symbols represent functions on ordinals (Bailhache, [A Tutorial Overview of Ordinal Notations](http://log.chez.com/text/logic/ordinal\_notations\_v2.pdf#page=18)).
