The ordinals begin with the following transfinite progression

\$0,1,2,3,\ldots,\omega,\omega+1,\omega+2,\omega+3,\ldots,\omega\cdot
2,\omega\cdot 2+1,\ldots,\omega\cdot
3,\ldots,\omega^2,\omega^2+1,\ldots,\omega^2+\omega,\ldots,\omega^2+\omega+1,\ldots,\omega^2+\omega\cdot
2,\ldots,\omega^3,\ldots,\$

\$\omega^\omega,\omega^\omega+1,\ldots,\omega^\omega+\omega,\ldots,\omega^\omega+\omega\cdot
2,\ldots,\omega^\omega\cdot
2,\ldots,\omega^{\omega^\omega},\ldots,\omega^{\omega^{\omega^\omega}},\ldots,\epsilon\_{0}\$

## Counting to \$\omega^2\$

We explain here in detail how to count to \$\omega^2\$. This is
something that anyone can learn to do, even young children.

First, some terminology: the *successor* of an ordinal \$\alpha\$,
sometimes written \$S\alpha\$, can be thought of as the ordinal coming
directly after \$\alpha\$. Since it's "directly" after \$\alpha\$, there
are no ordinals \$\beta\$ where \$\alpha\<\beta\<S\alpha\$.

We begin with the familiar natural numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. After all of
these is
[\$\omega\$](Omega "Omega"),
the least *infinite* ordinal. One way to think about what "infinite"
means is that it's larger than all finite numbers. (There are other
formulations such as Dedekind-infiniteness if we need to do this without
reference to \$\mathbb N\$)

Then, we take the successor of \$\omega\$, \$S\omega\$, and get an
ordinal equal to \$\omega+1\$. The \$+\$ here is a bit different from
ordinary addition on natural numbers, that is often informally thought
of as "putting two numbers together", and it's recursively defined for
ordinals.

We continue with \$SS\omega=\omega+2\$, \$SSS\omega=\omega+3\$, etc.,
until we reach \$\omega\times 2=\omega+\omega\$. This ordinal is larger
than \$\omega+n\$ for any natural number \$n\$. (Leaving out the
noncommutativity part for this explanation?)

We can also add natural numbers to this ordinal, for example
\$\omega+\omega+5=SSSSS(\omega+\omega)\$.

## The ordinals below [\$\epsilon_0\$](Epsilon_naught "Epsilon naught")

We shall give here an account of the attractive finitary represenation
of the ordinals below
[\$\epsilon_0\$](Epsilon_naught "Epsilon naught").
