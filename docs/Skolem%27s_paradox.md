*Skolem's paradox* is an apparent contradiction that arises from the
Lowenheim-Skolem theorem. We can consider a first-order theory
containing axioms that appear to not be satisfiable by a countable
model, such as
[union](ZFC#Union "ZFC")
along with "an uncountable set exists". But if there's an uncountable
set that satisfies this, then applying the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem
downwards, there must be a countable model \$M\$ of this theory too.

The resolution of this confusion is that there are members \$x\$ of
\$M\$ which are *locally uncountable*: that is, \$M\vDash\`\`x\textrm{
is uncountable}"\$. Since \$M\$ is in reality countable and transitive,
\$x\$ must be countable, but \$M\$ thinks that \$x\$ is uncountable.

## Examples

An example of this phenomenon is the model
\$M=\textrm{HF}\cup\\\omega\\\$: in this model, there doesn't exist a
bijection between \$\omega\$ and \$\mathbb N\$, so
\$M\vDash\`\`\omega\textrm{ is uncountable}"\$ <span class="small">even
though they are the same set. \$\omega=\mathbb N\$ is the only infinite
set in \$M\$ and it is not a bijection because every bijection is a
relation, i.e. a set of ordered pairs, and ordered pairs are (at most)
two-element sets (e.g., \$(x, y)=\\x, \\x, y\\\\\$ or \$(x, y)=\\\\x\\,
\\x, y\\\\\$ depending on convention) while \$\omega\$ contains \$3\$
that has three elements.</span>\[ [*citation

\]. \$\textrm{HF}\$ is the class of [hereditarily finite
sets](Hereditary_Cardinality#Hereditarily_Finite_Sets "Hereditary Cardinality").

More "natural" examples show up with [heights of
models](Heights_of_models "Heights of models"),
whose ranks are often closed under union, pairing, and ordered pair
formation. For example, Arai gives an explicit example of a countable
\$\sigma\$ such that \$L\_\sigma\$ models
\$\textrm{KP}+\`\`\omega_1\textrm{ exists}\\"\$, and also gives a value
of \$(\omega_1)^{L\_\sigma}\$. <a
