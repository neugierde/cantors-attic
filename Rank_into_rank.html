</ul><p>A nontrivial <a href="Elementary_embedding" title="Elementary embedding">elementary
embedding</a>
$j:V_\lambda\to V_\lambda$ for some infinite ordinal $\lambda$ is
known as a <em>rank into rank embedding</em> and the axiom asserting that such
an embedding exists is usually denoted by $\text{I3}$, $\text{I2}$,
$\text{I1}$, $\mathcal{E}(V_\lambda)\neq \emptyset$ or some
variant thereof. The term applies to a hierarchy of such embeddings
increasing in large cardinal strength reaching toward the <a href="Kunen_inconsistency" title="Kunen inconsistency">Kunen
inconsistency</a>.
The axioms in this section are in some sense a technical restriction
falling out of Kunen’s proof that there can be no nontrivial elementary
embedding $j:V\to V$ in $\text{ZFC}$). An analysis of the proof shows
that there can be no nontrivial $j:V_{\lambda+2}\to V_{\lambda+2}$
and that if there is some ordinal $\delta$ and nontrivial rank to rank
embedding $j:V_\delta\to V_\delta$ then necessarily $\delta$ must
be a strong limit cardinal of cofinality $\omega$ or the successor of
one. By standing convention, it is assumed that rank into rank
embeddings are not the identity on their domains.</p>

<p>There are really two cardinals relevant to such embeddings: The large
cardinal is the critical point of $j$ (sometimes it is called just an
$\mathrm{I}n$ cardinal ($n=0,1,2,3$), but sometimes such a name is
avoided), often denoted $\mathrm{crit}(j)$ or sometimes $\kappa_0$,
and the other (not quite so large) cardinal is $\lambda$. In order to
emphasize the two cardinals, the axiom is sometimes written as
$E(\kappa,\lambda)$ (or $\text{I3}(\kappa,\lambda)$, etc.) as in
<a class="citation" href="#Kanamori2009">(Kanamori, 2009)</a>. The cardinal $\lambda$ is
determined by defining the <em>critical sequence of $j$</em>. Set $\kappa_0 =
\mathrm{crit}(j)$ and $\kappa_{n+1}=j(\kappa_n)$. Then $\lambda =
\sup \langle \kappa_n : n &lt;\omega\rangle$ and is the first
fixed point of $j$ that occurs above $\kappa_0$. Note that, unlike
many of the other large cardinals appearing in the literature, the
ordinal $\lambda$ is <em>not</em> the first target of the critical point; it
is the $\omega^{th}$ $j$-iterate of the critical point.</p>

<p>As a result of the strong closure properties of rank into rank
embeddings, their critical points are
<a href="Huge" title="Huge">huge</a> and in
fact $n$-huge for every $n$. This aspect of the large cardinal property
is often called $\omega$-hugeness and the term <em>$\omega$-huge
cardinal</em> is sometimes used to refer to the critical point of some rank
into rank embedding.</p>

<h2 id="the-texti3-axiom">
<a class="anchor" href="#the-texti3-axiom" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The $\text{I3}$ Axiom</h2>

<p>The $\text{I3}$ axiom asserts, generally, that there is some embedding
$j:V_\lambda\to V_\lambda$.</p>

<p>$\text{I3}$ is also denoted as
$\mathcal{E}(V_\lambda)\neq\emptyset$ where
$\mathcal{E}(V_\lambda)$ is the set of all elementary embeddings from
$V_\lambda$ to $V_\lambda$, or sometimes even
$\text{I3}(\kappa,\lambda)$ when mention of the relevant cardinals is
necessary.</p>

<p>In its general form, the axiom asserts that the embedding preserves all
first-order structure but fails to specify how much second-order
structure is preserved by the embedding. The case that <em>no</em> second-order
structure is preserved is also sometimes denoted by $\text{I3}$. In
this specific case $\text{I3}$ denotes the weakest kind of rank into
rank embedding and so the $\text{I3}$ notation for the axiom is
somewhat ambiguous. To eliminate this ambiguity we say $j$ is
$E_0(\lambda)$ when $j$ preserves only first-order structure.</p>

<h3 id="e_n-axioms">
<a class="anchor" href="#e_n-axioms" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>$E_n$ axioms</h3>

<p>The axiom can be strengthened and refined in a natural way by asserting
that various degrees of second-order correctness are preserved by the
embeddings. A rank into rank embedding $j$ is said to be $\Sigma^1_n$
or <em>$\Sigma^1_n$ correct</em> if, for every $\Sigma^1_n$ formula $\Phi$
and $A\subseteq V_\lambda$ the elementary schema holds for $j,\Phi$,
and $A$: \(V\_\\lambda\\models\\Phi(A) \\Leftrightarrow
V\_\\lambda\\models\\Phi(j(A)).\)</p>

<p>The more specific axiom $E_n(\lambda)$ asserts that some
$j\in\mathcal{E}(V_\lambda)$ is $\Sigma^1_{2n}$.</p>

<p>The “$2n$” subscript in the axiom $E_n(\lambda)$ is incorporated so
that the axioms $E_m(\lambda)$ and $E_n(\lambda)$ where $m&lt;n$ are
strictly increasing in strength. This is somewhat subtle. For $n$ odd,
$j$ is $\Sigma^1_n$ if and only if $j$ is $\Sigma^1_{n+1}$ (shown by
Donald Martin). However, for $n$ even, $j$ being $\Sigma^1_{n+1}$ is
<em>significantly</em> stronger than a $j$ being
$\Sigma^1_n$<a class="citation" href="#Laver1997">(Laver, 1997)</a>.</p>

<p>$E_{n+1}$ strongly implies $E_n$. It also implies the consistency of
$E_n$ strengthened by adding “with an arbitrarily large first
target”.<a class="citation" href="#Kentaro2007">(Kentaro, 2007)</a></p>

<p>The $\mathrm{I3}$ axiom implies the

<a href="I4" class="mw-redirect" title="I4">Axioms $\mathrm{I}_4^n$</a>

<h2 id="the-texti2-axiom">
<a class="anchor" href="#the-texti2-axiom" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The $\text{I2}$ Axiom</h2>

<p>The $\text{I2}$ axiom asserts the existence of some elementary
embedding $j:V\to M$ with $V_\lambda\subseteq M$ where $\lambda$ is
defined as the $\omega^{th}$ $j$-iterate of the critical point.</p>

<p>Although this axiom asserts the existence of a <em>class</em> embedding with a
very strong closure property, it is in fact equivalent to an embedding
$j:V_\lambda\to V_\lambda$ with $j^+$ preserving well-founded
relations on $V_\lambda$.</p>

<p>So this axioms preserves <em>some</em> second-order structure of $V_\lambda$
and is in fact equivalent to $E_1(\lambda)$ in the hierarchy defined
above.</p>

<h3 id="the-ie-axiom">
<a class="anchor" href="#the-ie-axiom" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The $IE$ axiom</h3>

<p>A specific property of $\text{I2}$ embeddings is that they are
<em>iterable</em> (i.e. the direct limit of directed system of embeddings is
well-founded). In the literature (D. Martin, Infinite games, in: Proc.
ICM, Helsinki, 1978), $IE(\lambda)$ asserts that $j:V_\lambda\to
V_\lambda$ is iterable and $IE(\lambda)$ falls strictly between
$E_0(\lambda)$ and $E_1(\lambda)$.</p>

<p>In other words, $IE$ asserts that there is $e : V_\delta \prec
V_\delta$ whose $\alpha$-th iteration is well-founded for all
$\alpha \in \mathrm{Ord}$.<a class="citation" href="#Kentaro2007">(Kentaro, 2007)</a></p>

<dl>
  <dt>$IE^\omega$ asserts that there is a non-trivial elementary embedding $e</dt>
  <dd>V_\delta \prec V_\delta$ with $crit(e) = \kappa$ such that the
direct limit of $\langle e^{(n)} : V_\delta ≺ V_\delta | n \in
\omega \rangle$ is well
founded.<a class="citation" href="#Kentaro2007">(Kentaro, 2007)</a>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="ultrapowers">
<a class="anchor" href="#ultrapowers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ultrapowers</h3>

<p>As a result of the strong closure property of $\text{I2}$, the
equivalence mentioned above cannot be through an analysis of some
ultrapower embedding. Instead, the equivalence is established by
constructing a directed system of embeddings of various ultrapowers and
using reflection properties of the critical points of the embeddings.
The direct limit is well-founded since well-founded relations are
preserved by $j^+$. The use of both direct and indirect limits, in
conjunction with reflection arguments, is typical for establishing the
properties of rank into rank embeddings.</p>

<p>An $\mathrm{I2}$ cardinal can be forced to be the $\omega$-time target
of an $\mathrm{I3}$ cardinal.<a class="citation" href="#Kentaro2007">(Kentaro, 2007)</a></p>

<h2 id="the-texti1-axiom">
<a class="anchor" href="#the-texti1-axiom" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The $\text{I1}$ Axiom</h2>

<p>$\text{I1}$ asserts the existence of a nontrivial elementary embedding
$j:V_{\lambda+1}\to V_{\lambda+1}$.</p>

<p>This axiom is sometimes denoted
$\mathcal{E}(V_{\lambda+1})\neq\emptyset$.</p>

<p>Any such embedding preserves all second-order properties of
$V_\lambda$ and so is $\Sigma^1_n$ for all $n$. To emphasize the
preservation of second-order properties, the axiom is also sometimes
written as $E_\omega(\lambda)$. In this case, restricting the
embedding to $V_\lambda$ and forming $j^+$ as above yields the
original embedding.</p>

<h3 id="strenghtenings">
<a class="anchor" href="#strenghtenings" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Strenghtenings</h3>

<p>Strengthening this axiom in a natural way leads to the $\text{I0}$
axiom, i.e. asserting that embeddings of the form
<a href="L_of_V_lambda%2B1" title="L of V lambda+1">$j:L(V_{\lambda+1})\to
L(V_{\lambda+1})$</a>
exist.</p>

<p>There are also other natural strengthenings of $\text{I1}$, though it
is not entirely clear how they relate to the $\text{I0}$ axiom. For
example, one can assume the existence of elementary embeddings
satisfying $\text{I1}$ which extend to embeddings $j:M\to M$ where $M$
is a transitive class inner model and add various requirements to $M$.
These requirements must not entail that $M$ satisfies the axiom of
choice by the Kunen inconsistency. Requirements that have been
considered include assuming $M$ contains $V_{\lambda+1}$, $M$
satisfies $DC_\lambda$, $M$ satisfies replacement for formulas
containing $j$ as a parameter, $j(\mathrm{crit}(j))$ is arbitrarily
large in $M$, etc.</p>

<h2 id="large-cardinal-properties-of-critical-points">
<a class="anchor" href="#large-cardinal-properties-of-critical-points" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Large Cardinal Properties of Critical Points</h2>

<p>The critical points of rank into rank embeddings have many strong
reflection properties. They are measurable, $n$-huge for all $n$ (hence
the terminology $\omega$-huge mentioned in the introduction) and
partially supercompact.</p>

<p>Using $\kappa_0$ as a seed, one can form the ultrafilter
\(U=\\{X\\subseteq\\mathcal{P}(\\kappa\_0): j\`\`\\kappa\_0\\in
j(X)\\}.\) Thus, $\kappa_0$ is a measurable cardinal.</p>

<p>In fact, for any $n$, $\kappa_0$ is also $n$-huge as witnessed by the
ultrafilter \(U=\\{X\\subseteq\\mathcal{P}(\\kappa\_n):
j\`\`\\kappa\_n\\in j(X)\\}.\) This motivates the term $\omega$-huge
cardinal mentioned in the introduction.</p>

<p>Letting $j^n$ denote the $n^{th}$ iteration of $j$, then
\(V\_\\lambda\\models \`\`\\lambda\\text{ is supercompact"}.\) To see
this, suppose $\kappa_0\leq \theta &lt;\kappa_n$, then
\(U=\\{X\\subseteq\\mathcal{P}\_{\\kappa\_0}(\\theta):
j^n\`\`\\theta\\in j^n(X)\\}\) winesses the $\theta$-compactness of
$\kappa_0$ (in $V_\lambda$). For this last claim, it is enough that
$\kappa_0(j)$ is $&lt;\lambda$-supercompact, i.e. not *fully*
supercompact in $V$. In this case, however, $\kappa_0$ *could* be
fully supercompact.</p>

<p>Critical points of rank-into-rank embeddings also exhibit some
*upward* reflection properties. For example, if $\kappa$ is a
critical point of some embedding witnessing
$\text{I3}(\kappa,\lambda)$, then there must exist another embedding
witnessing $\text{I3}(\kappa’,\lambda)$ with critical point <em>above</em>
$\kappa$! This upward type of reflection is not exhibited by large
cardinals below
<a href="Extendible" title="Extendible">extendible</a>
cardinals in the large cardinal hierarchy.</p>

<h2 id="algebras-of-elementary-embeddings">
<a class="anchor" href="#algebras-of-elementary-embeddings" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Algebras of elementary embeddings</h2>

<p>If $j,k\in\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$, then
$j^+(k)\in\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ as well. We therefore define a
binary operation $*$ on $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ called application
defined by $j*k=j^{+}(k)$. The binary operation $*$ together with
composition $\circ$ satisfies the following identities:</p>

<p>1. $(j\circ k)\circ l=j\circ(k\circ l),\,j\circ k=(j*k)\circ
j,\,j*(k*l)=(j\circ k)*l,\,j*(k\circ l)=(j*k)\circ(j*l)$</p>

<p>2. $j*(k*l)=(j*k)*(j*l)$ (self-distributivity).</p>

<p>Identity 2 is an algebraic consequence of the identities in 1.</p>

<p>If $j\in\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ is a nontrivial elementary embedding,
then $j$ freely generates a subalgebra of
$(\mathcal{E}_{\lambda},*,\circ)$ with respect to the identities in
1, and $j$ freely generates a subalgebra of
$(\mathcal{E}_{\lambda},*)$ with respect to the identity 2.</p>

<p>If $j_{n}\in\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ for all $n\in\omega$, then
$\sup\{\textrm{crit}(j_{0}*\dots*j_{n})\mid
n\in\omega\}=\lambda$ where the implied parentheses a grouped on the
left (for example, $j*k*l=(j*k)*l$).</p>

<p>Suppose now that $\gamma$ is a limit ordinal with
$\gamma&lt;\lambda$. Then define an equivalence relation
$\equiv^{\gamma}$ on $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ where
$j\equiv^{\gamma}k$ if and only if $j(x)\cap V_{\gamma}=k(x)\cap
V_{\gamma}$ for each $x\in V_{\gamma}$. Then the equivalence
relation $\equiv^{\gamma}$ is a congruence on the algebra
$(\mathcal{E}_{\lambda},*,\circ)$. In other words, if

<p>$\mathrm{I3}$ and other $C^{(n)}$ variants:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assuming $\mathrm{I3}(\kappa,\delta)$, if $\delta$ is a limit
cardinal (instead of a successor of a limit cardinal – Kunen’s
Theorem excludes other cases), it is equal to
$sup\{j^m(\kappa):m\lt \omega\}$ where $j$ is the elementary
embedding. Then $\kappa$ and $j^m(\kappa)$ are
$C^{(n)}$-<a href="Superstrong" title="Superstrong">superstrong</a>,
$C^{(n)}$-<a href="Supercompact" title="Supercompact">supercompact</a>,
$C^{(n)}$-<a href="Extendible" title="Extendible">extendible</a>,
$C^{(n)}$-$m$-<a href="Huge" title="Huge">huge</a>
and $C^{(n)}$-superhuge in $V_\delta$, for all $n$ and $m$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Definitions of $C^{(n)}$ variants of rank-into-rank cardinals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$\kappa$ is called
<strong><a href="Correct" class="mw-redirect" title="Correct">$C^{(n)}$-$\mathrm{I3}$ cardinal</a></strong>
if it is an $\mathrm{I3}$ cardinal, witnessed by some elementary
embedding $j: V_\delta\rightarrow V_\delta$, with
$j(\kappa)\in C^{(n)}$ (i.e. ($1$-)$C^{(n)}$-$E_0$).</li>
  <li>$\kappa$ is called <strong>$C^{(n)+}$-$\mathrm{I3}$ cardinal</strong> if it is
an $\mathrm{I3}$ cardinal, witnessed by some elementary embedding
$j : V_\delta\rightarrow V_\delta$, with $\delta\in C^{(n)}$
(i.e. $\omega$-$C^{(n)}$-$E_0$).
    <ul>
      <li>Note: For every $n\ge 1$, if $\delta$ is a limit ordinal and
$j : V_\delta\rightarrow V_\delta$ witnesses that $\kappa$
is $\mathrm{I3}$, then
$(\forall_{m\lt\omega}j^m(\kappa)\in
C^{(n)})\iff\delta\in C^{(n)}$.
        <ul>
          <li>$E_i$ cardinals are $E_0$, so this applies to
$\omega$-$C^{(n)}$-$E_i$ cardinals.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>$\kappa$ is called <strong>$C^{(n)}$-$\mathrm{I1}$ cardinal</strong> if it is
an $\mathrm{I1}$ cardinal, witnessed by some elementary embedding
$j : V_{\delta+1}\rightarrow V_{\delta+1}$, with
$j(\kappa)\in C^{(n)}$ (i.e. ($1$-)$C^{(n)}$-$E_\omega$).</li>
</ul>

<p>More generally</p>

<ul>
  <li>$\kappa$ is called <strong>$C^{(n)}$-$E_0$ cardinal</strong> if it is an $E_i$
cardinal, witnessed by some elementary embedding $j :
V_\delta\rightarrow V_\delta$, with $j(\kappa) \in C^{(n)}$.</li>
  <li>$\kappa$ is called <strong>$m$-$C^{(n)}$-$E_0$ cardinal</strong> if it is an
$E_i$ cardinal, witnessed by some elementary embedding $j :
V_\delta\rightarrow V_\delta$, with $j^{m’}(\kappa) \in
C^{(n)}$ for all $1 \le m’\le m$.</li>
  <li>$\kappa$ is called <strong>$\omega$-$C^{(n)}$-$E_0$ cardinal</strong> if it is
an $E_i$ cardinal, witnessed by some elementary embedding $j :
V_\delta\rightarrow V_\delta$, with $\delta \in C^{(n)}$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even more generally</p>

<ul>
  <li>$\kappa$ is called <strong>$C^{(n)}$-$E_i$ cardinal</strong> if it is an $E_i$
cardinal, witnessed by some $\Sigma_i$ elementary embedding $j :
V_{\delta+1}\rightarrow V_{\delta+1}$, with $j(\kappa) \in
C^{(n)}$.</li>
  <li>$\kappa$ is called <strong>$m$-$C^{(n)}$-$E_i$ cardinal</strong> if it is an
$E_i$ cardinal, witnessed by some $\Sigma_i$ elementary embedding
$j : V_{\delta+1}\rightarrow V_{\delta+1}$, with
$j^{m’}(\kappa) \in C^{(n)}$ for all $1 \le m’\le m$.</li>
  <li>$\kappa$ is called <strong>$\omega$-$C^{(n)}$-$E_i$ cardinal</strong> if it is
an $E_i$ cardinal, witnessed by some $\Sigma_i$ elementary
embedding $j : V_{\delta+1}\rightarrow V_{\delta+1}$, with
$\delta \in C^{(n)}$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, $m$-$C^{(n)}$-$E_i$ cardinals for larger $m$, $n$ and $i$
have also this property for smaller parameters. In particular, every
$C^{(n)}$-$\mathrm{I1}$ cardinal is also $C^{(n)}$-$\mathrm{I3}$.</p>

<p>Results about $\mathrm{I3}$:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If $\kappa$ is $C^{(n)}$-$\mathrm{I3}$, then $\kappa\in
C^{(n)}$.</li>
  <li>Every $\mathrm{I3}$-cardinal is $C^{(1)}$-$\mathrm{I3}$ and
$C^{(1)+}$-$\mathrm{I3}$.</li>
  <li>If $\kappa$ is $C^{(n)}$-$\mathrm{I3}$, then it is
$C^{(n)}$-$m$-huge, for all $m$, and there is a normal
<a href="Ultrafilter" class="mw-redirect" title="Ultrafilter">ultrafilter</a>
$\mathcal{U}$ over $\kappa$ such that
$\{\alpha\lt\kappa: \alpha$ is $C^{(n)}$-$m$-huge for every
$m\}\in\mathcal{U}$.</li>
  <li>If $\kappa$ is $m$-$C^{(n)}$-$E_1$, then there is a normal
ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ over $\kappa$ such that the set of
cardinals $\alpha &lt; \kappa$ that are $m$-$C^{(n)}$-$E_0$
belongs to $\mathcal{U}$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Results about $\mathrm{I1}$:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If $\kappa$ is $C^{(n)}$-$\mathrm{I1}$, then the least $\delta$
such that there is an elementary embedding $j: V_{\delta+1} \to
V_{\delta+1}$ with $crit(j)=\kappa$ and $j(\kappa)\in C^{(n)}$
is smaller than the first ordinal in $C^{(n+1)}$ greater than
$\kappa$.</li>
</ul>

<p>General results:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By simple reflection argument: The least $m$-$C^{(n)}$-$E_i$
cardinal is smaller than the first cardinal in $C^{(n+1)}$ (for all
$m, i \le \omega$ and $n \ge 1$) and therefore smaller than the
least $C^{(n+1)}$-$E_0$ cardinal. In particular:
    <ul>
      <li>The least $C^{(n)}$-$\mathrm{I3}$ cardinal is not
$C^{(n+1)}$-$\mathrm{I3}$.</li>
      <li>The least $C^{(n)}$-$\mathrm{I1}$ cardinal is not
$C^{(n+1)}$-$\mathrm{I1}$.</li>
      <li>The least $C^{(n)}$-$\mathrm{I1}$ cardinal, if it exists, is
smaller than the first ordinal in $C^{(n+1)}$.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The least $m$-$C^{(n)}$-$E_i$ cardinal is not $(m +
1)$-$C^{(n)}$-$E_i$ (for all $m \ge 1$, $n \ge 2$ and $i \le
\omega$).</li>
  <li>If $\kappa$ is an $m$-$C^{(n)}$-$E_{i+2}$ cardinal (for $i, n &lt;
\omega$ and $m \le \omega$), then the set of $m$-$C^{(n)}$-$E_i$
cardinals is unbounded below $\kappa$.</li>
</ul>
